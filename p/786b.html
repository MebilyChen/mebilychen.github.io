<p>言情题材自然而然需要分析各线感情描写的好坏。感情描写的好坏标准仍遵循二人感情矛盾推进的水平，就如没有人喜欢看两个人一来就相爱直到故事结束,那叫“感情描写太平，寡淡无味”,同样如果两个人从头一直折腾到尾，且折腾的都是老掉牙的烂梗,那叫”狗血”。</p>

<p>早上好呀咩碳 别忘了开个帖子研究一下爽文和爽点  </p>

<p>总结一下一罐遇到过的sb女“忧伤”凡尔赛（如果是男生权当我视野狭隘）：</p>
<ol>
<li>我上次路过一个旧书摊，竟然看到我多年前闲的没事花了几天随意写得烂文（注意要强调自己觉得有多烂）被摆在上面卖，好家伙都给我整出书了，不嫌丢人啊太恶心了。</li>
<li>领导给我涨薪了，涨了好多，多到我好愧疚，我难过得要死了，跟亲朋好友都抱怨了一番。  </li>
<li>（发了很多大胸照片）卧槽这帮郭楠有病吧，谁愿意搭理你们啊，冲业绩一样给我发私信，抑郁了。（这个其实不太算）</li>
<li>奖学金太好拿了吧，我看别人都在卷，我就整天躺床上啥都没有最后还评上了，怪不好意思的。</li>
</ol>
<p>总结一下sb女“忧伤”凡尔赛的要点：</p>
<ol>
<li>一定要贬低自己，毫不留情地贬低自己，可以举出有利于贬低自己的事实，但要体现出这只是自己的想法</li>
<li>摆出一个事实证明自己的想法是错的，（毫不留情地）抬高自己，体现自己现实的美好和自己自卑想法的冲突</li>
<li>作为一个sb女的“忧伤”凡尔赛的重点来了：在最后的总结句一定要传达“丧”或“厌恶”等的负面气息，不承认或避免承认现实的美好，继续强调自己的自卑想法。比如自己因为这件事而伤心，做出了什么伤心的举动（还影响了别人）。</li>
</ol>
<p>重点就是，现实说明你很棒，但是你不认为你很棒，最后你否定了现实继续认为你很烂，其实到这里还可以接受，你就自卑呗。但你言语间种种迹象表明你认为自己不烂。你在认为自己不烂的情况下摆出了认为自己不烂的理由，甚至为了强调自己不烂还专门强调出现实情况有多美好，最后结论却说了一句“我很烂”。<br>我直接？？？，给我爬。    </p>
<p>举例：就说涨薪吧。<br>正常人：领导给我涨薪啦哈哈哈没有白努力  <br>自卑女： 我什么都没干，领导就给我涨薪了，感觉好愧疚 <br>sb“忧伤”凡尔赛女：领导给我涨了好多钱，实在太多了，都跟他秘书差不多一样了，我也没做啥呀，整天混吃等死，也就突发奇想努努力，不知怎的就冲上了业绩。隔壁小哥比我努力多了，半天没啥成果，就没给他涨薪。哎呀想想多不好意思，我明天请他吃顿饭吧（emm这个其实感觉还好？）  <br>sb“忧伤”凡尔赛女（再试一次）：领导给我涨了好多钱，好愧疚，赶紧和朋友吐槽了一番；我轻松评上奖学金，看别人都块卷死了，真抱歉  <br>艹，我真的写不出那个味道，艹，果然人之间是有差距的</p>
<p>像我原来形容这种人就都是“得便宜还卖乖”，现在可以再加一句“NMSL”</p>

<p>段落1：设下第一层铺垫，抬高敌人，贬低主角，这里最重要的是主角自己都认为要输。<br>段落2：设下第二层铺垫，继续抬高敌人，黄蓉暗中相助而主角错失，把读者最后一丝希望灭掉。<br>段落3：设下第三层铺垫，主角开始胡来了，让人嘲笑之余，也勾起了强烈的好奇心——这傻小子在干吗？<br>段落4：继续推进剧情，明示主角把这场比试给“误会”了，他认为还是考校武艺，继续吊高读者期待，大家会觉得傻小子郭靖能胜过武学大宗师黄药师吗？（这里欧阳克已经退出比赛，对手转换成黄药师，真正的较量开始）<br>段落5：用大段的描写烘托碧海潮生曲的厉害，但是郭靖守得严密，令读者大感兴趣，这时候肯定都隐隐兴奋起来了吧？<br>段落6：这一段非常重要，可以说是这段高潮中的顶点，妙笔生花的那朵花。黄药师继续加大功力，配角欧阳锋和洪七公都不得不暗暗抵御，说明黄药师动了真格的了，而郭靖居然能用左右互搏化解。依然是难听的空空空、突突突，甚至脱下鞋子“不雅”地抗衡。<br>请问看到这里有哪位读者会嘲笑郭靖傻吗？只怕都惊讶地张大了嘴巴，好笑之中却又觉得极度的爽快了吧？以一种粗鄙的方式挑战权威，让城里人别再看不起乡下人，这种效果可说让人爽到了骨头缝里去了！<br>段落7：是高潮过后开始回落，郭靖表现再出色也不可能打败黄药师，出于爱才的心思，黄药师收手了。<br>段落8：大妙！极秒！绝妙！是画龙点睛的那一笔。<br>因为郭靖的出色表现黄药师改变了主意，想把黄蓉许配给他，可是傻小子到底是傻小子，在黄蓉的暗示下匆忙磕头，但却搞不懂这是什么意思，从而错失机会。</p>

<p>利用误导和诱导的手法，让读者对情节产生错误的判断，一旦读者有了判断，他们就会想要看看结局是否和他们判断的一样。可是当读者看到结局却是相反的结局，却又那么顺利成章，那么，读者是不是会感觉一种非常刺激的感觉？夸大那件事的不可能性困难性，误导读者进入那种感觉（越真实越好），使其自己也觉得失望，轻而易举的使用别人想不到的方法去完成。让别人都觉得他做的事很荒唐，可最后却出人意料，带给别人意想不到的效果或是成绩。</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>扶起一个阿斗效忠自己，但是其实谁也不知道背后的主导者是主角。只有读者知道。</li>
<li>金手指：主角的现状中，急需要丹药、武器等东西，及需要某物品才能提升。得到新手指，读者期待用其出风头和再得好处，如：对主角的修炼升级、打败敌人、和改变现状。（冲突：主角正需要某丹（东西），准备得到时，却出现另一个敌人打断了他要得到，或被他得到。主角修炼出了岔子，处于极度危险之中，出现了敌人。）</li>
<li>受保护人的，反而保护了大家</li>
<li>连续爆发杀仇人</li>
<li>校花或厉害人物送东西给主角</li>
<li>设定目标，主角实现</li>
<li>被别人忌妒的感觉（别人为求一件上刀山，下油锅的宝物，主角那里摆地摊似地送，要多少有多少，一群大官贵族艳羡，眼气，嫉妒的要死，但是还不能不巴结。<br>）</li>
<li>主角冒充有名气的人，去某处骗东西(百万英镑)</li>
<li>没有名气的时候（或许只是个扫地的，看图书馆的。）却有很多大的帮派或者人物对他毕恭毕敬。（隐藏身份）可是顶头上司却看不上他。最后出事的时候站出来，遭到上司呵斥，可是对方的敌人却被他吓的慌张撤退。</li>
<li>聪明人都会叫自己身边的人或主人别去惹主角，推出一个强大的人物说宁愿得罪那强大的人也不能去惹到主角。</li>
<li>将别人视为不可抵挡的致命一击轻松的化解，如把别人释放来的魔法光球揉捏成团当球踢还，或是拿他的法力来玩，如用他用本命真元放出的三位真火做烤肉。</li>
<li>别人拿自己儿子的优点来鄙视主角，却不知道他儿子的能力却是主角的功劳。</li>
<li>最烂最没用的东西，到了他手里却全成了宝，或是改成了宝，拿去坑人，或是扭转乾坤改造成真正具有价值的东西。</li>
<li>跟正派的人打架，别人都以为他会用光明正大的手法，谁知道他却用阴的手段打。还一脸的引以为傲。</li>
<li>对战的时候主角只是拿了一把破刀子，而对手拿的却是一把削铁如泥的宝刀。大家都以为主角会败，不成想那刀却被主角给搞断了。一把厉害的刀厉害的不在与它本身，而在于使用它的人。</li>
<li>一个个别人都很尊敬的人物，可是一看到主角的出现就都乖乖的低首，与之前的叱咤风云的高傲大相径庭。</li>
<li>释放绝技时，周围人的震撼，可是结束以后却淡淡的一句：一会去哪嫖娼？</li>
<li>破坏规则，挑战权威，满足叛逆心理。</li>
<li>升级中出现高级才有的异像（或一开始修炼就有高深的理解），短时间内完成别人快要绝望的事</li>
<li>设定一个强大的组织，让主角成为组织里的头号通缉犯或是拉拢对象，或是那个组织惧怕的人物。神秘的身份。</li>

<p>“爽”点的本质以及一些衍生</p>
<p>讲一下到底什么是爽点，普遍大家知道的就是打脸，但如果一篇文完全走感情流类型或者比较日常向，非事业线打脸文，不靠打脸又改怎么去满足读者？<br>这里我讲一种方法:调动情绪满足法。</p>
<p>大多剧情流文的普遍看点在爽字上，爽点为什么能拉住读者接着往下看，其实本质就是看到主角受欺负，调动了读者的愤怒，所以作者利用打脸配角去满足抚平读者情绪。</p>
<p>方法本质:作者利用剧情调动读者情绪，满足读者情绪需求，拿情绪去吊胃口。<br>情绪划分:喜怒哀乐甚至更多，在要达到“爽”的结果时，分调动读者一种情绪和一种以上。<br>一种的，直接调动读者“爽”情绪:一下子爽，举例为花很多钱想买什么买什么，中了好几个亿，大佬们都爱我。</p>
<p>2种及以上的:就要分析先靠一个剧情调动读者某种情绪，再靠另一个剧情抚平读者该种情绪。<br>打脸剧情:先安排主角惨，被配角搞，调动读者对主角的同情情绪以及对配角的愤怒，这个时候作者接下来就分别靠主角高光时刻，以及配角惨来满足抚平读者。</p>
<p>再比如受或者攻是渣男，受渣了攻，或者攻渣了受，调动了读者的愤怒情绪，读者期望看到虐渣，这个时候不一定靠打脸剧情来满足读者的爽点，可以靠虐渣男，渣男想得到什么却得不到这种方式来满足，进一步再让渣男从中成长，读者会有种人物被教训后成长懂事的满足感。</p>
<p>在这个过程中要有指向性，你要明白这个剧情你调动了读者对文中哪个人物或者几个人物哪几种情绪，再分别在接下来安排剧情一一满足。</p>
<p>再分析一个套路“追妻火葬场”:读者喜欢这个剧情，为什么，因为爽，如何体现爽，普遍两种写法。<br>第一种:女主/受不爱了，渣男反而回心转意爱了，而在之前作者已经通过一些剧情调动了读者对渣男的愤怒，之后作者开始抚平读者，渣男想要得到女主爱但得不到来虐渣男，这里甚至不用普遍的打脸配角之类的就可以达到爽的感觉，重点指向在渣男。<br>第二种:前期调动了读者对女主/受的同情，后期不仅让渣男得不到主角的爱，还要让主角发展更好，一般就是娱乐圈文主角突然火了。<br>在追妻这个过程中，前期调动了读者对于女主和男主两个人物两种情绪，第二种写法就是分别满足了读者对于这两个人物期望看到的。<br>　　<br>再举个例子，无限流闯关类的文，看点是什么，每章也可以调动读者情绪再去满足吗？</p>
<p>我拿无限流解密类文举个例子，所有人被困，怎么脱困，这是从剧情上去解决，前期可以调动读者情绪有恐惧，惊疑，读者期待主角去解决甚至期待主角能碾压恐怖的boss，或者我这里不把读者情绪当回事，我把解密吊胃口归类为靠主线剧情拉读者期待感的谜团解惑法。<br>但谜团解惑可以再跟调动情绪满足法两种结合，比如可以普遍到刑侦文，我靠谜团解惑拉主线吊读者胃口，嫌疑人是谁，我再靠情绪调动法激起读者对某个配角行为的厌恶愤怒，希望惩治他，然后主角的有所作为就是再满足抚平读者这种情绪。</p>
<p>为什么要说到爽点本质是在调动读者情绪再去满足读者期待，抚平，是希望在安排剧情时，大家总体的要去看这章是不是过于平淡，有没有调动读者情绪，或者一个大剧情是不是有点没头没尾，你调动了读者情绪后，却不去满足，或者连续的几章调动读者某种情绪却不去满足是不是让读者失去耐心。</p>

<p>感伤主义文学：得名于英国作家斯泰恩的游记《感伤的旅行》 “墓园诗派”。启蒙文学的支流或是其继续和发展。它产生于英国，是当时英国软弱的城乡中小资产者情绪的反映。面对大变动的社会现实，痛感自己生活的失败，既不满贵族和资产阶级的暴虐，又不理解社会变革的原因，产生了感伤的情绪。感伤主义作家在创作上突出地强调感觉和感情，着力描写个人内心的感受，渲染中下层人物的痛苦和不幸，作品充满感伤情调。</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>这派作家夸大感情的作用，细致地描写人物的心情和不幸遭遇，以引起读者的同情和共鸣，表现了对社会现实的不满和对劳动人民的怜悯之心，具有资产阶级人道主义思想，反映了新兴资产阶级的愿望与要求。他们常以生、死、黑夜、孤独为题材，抒发自己的哀思的失意，格调悲哀，语言晦暗，充满悲观失望的情调。喜用哀歌、旅行日记、回忆录、书简等文学体裁。感伤主义文学流传到法国、德国和俄国，影响了一批作家的创作风格，其中最著名的感伤主义作家有英国的劳伦斯·斯泰恩和詹姆斯汤姆生、法国的卢梭、德国的歌德、俄国的卡拉姆辛等。</p>

<p>伤感文学 是作者抒发自己感情或对社会的悲伤、忧伤的、心凉的作品。而伤痕文学 典故和由来：十年文革期间，无数知识青年被卷入了上山下乡运动中。“伤痕文学”的出现直接起因于上山下乡，它主要描述了知青、知识分子，受迫害官员及城乡普通民众在那个不堪回首的年代悲剧性的遭遇。</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>其次 ，在艺术表现上，”伤痕文学”显得十分幼稚。我们可以发现，许多小说中的语言明显带有文革左倾的印痕，如在《班主任》中，作者这样形容张俊石老师：”像一架永不生锈的播种机，不断在学生们的心田上播下革命思想和知识的种子。”另外，<strong>由于”伤痕文学”作者们关注现实的强烈的责任感，他们常常会压抑不住激荡的情感而跳出来对某个情节直接高谈阔论，表述自己疗救时弊的观点，使作品的情感表露不免趋于肤浅。</strong></p>

<p>第三，”伤痕文学”作品中虽然重新出现了悲剧意识，但其悲剧精神却具有表层性的弱点。鲁迅曾经说过，”悲剧将人生有价值的东西毁灭给人看。”可见，悲剧的深化应该有两个层次：其一，是表现灾难；其二，是在灾难中展现崇高。而”伤痕文学”只是停留在悲剧的第一个层次上，<strong>作品一味注重悲惨故事的叙述而忽视了对人格的刻划。这样，主人公就只是单纯的受难者而非美的体现者，其悲剧只是灾难的展现而不是”美的毁灭”，只能引起人们”兔死狐悲式”的同情而不能给人以永恒的的震撼和心灵的升华。</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>例如，在孔捷生的短篇小说《在小河那边》（1979，2）中，作者力图展现在文革”血统论”的错误导向下所造成的悲剧：因父母被打倒，主人公严凉与穆兰受尽了折磨，他们在小河边相识并相爱结合了，幸福似乎降临在他们头上，然而他们却发现两人竟然是姐弟关系－－历史把他们分开，历史又这样无情地捉弄了他们！小说的悲剧色彩在这时达到了高潮，但在读者<strong>为这种”乱伦”惨剧叹息的同时却不能不感到其中过分的偶然性因素，这种刻意添加的悲惨无疑使作品显得虚假，同时也无法产生使人震撼的力度。</strong><br>最典型的例子就是刚刚提到的《在小河那边》，在作品描写了一场”乱伦”惨剧后，笔锋一转，写到了四人帮被粉碎，姐弟二人得到母亲被平反的消息，母亲工作的银行也表示要将二人从农村调回，安排工作，最令人吃惊的是，从母亲留下的一封遗书中他们得知，原来穆兰是母亲在战争中抱养的女儿，与严凉并无血缘关系！－－一切的阴翳都被排除，正像小说最后两节的题目一样：”飞向光明”、”鹊桥相会”。<strong>这种完满的”大团圆”结局无疑充满了人为的痕迹。</strong><br>又如，《从森林里来的孩子》林中少年孙长宁带着老师的遗愿与笛声，在无法报名的情况下闯进了音乐学院的考场，并恰巧碰到老师的知己主考。后者听着少年的笛声，仿佛看到了老朋友的身影，感到了老朋友生命的继续。这个情节无疑暗示了少年前途的光明，但其中却<strong>不免因其过份巧合与顺利而显得不够真实。</strong><br>再如，在《伤痕》中，当王晓华读罢母亲的遗书后，作者进行了一段人物”化悲痛为力量”的描写：<br>“她的苦痛的面庞忽然变得那样激愤。她默默无言地紧攥着小苏的手，瞪大了燃烧着火样的眸子，然后在心中低低地、缓缓地、一字一句地说道：’妈妈，亲爱的妈妈，你放心吧，女儿永远也不会忘记您和我心上的伤痛是谁戳下的。我一定不忘党的恩情，紧跟党中央，为党的事业贡献自己毕生的力量！’<br>夜，是静静的。黄浦江的水在向东滚滚奔流。忽然，远处传来巨轮上汽笛的大声怒吼。晓华便觉得浑身的热血一下子都在往上沸涌。于是，她猛地一把拉了小苏的胳膊，下了石阶，朝着灯火通明的南京路大步走去……”<br>这两个段落无疑是在讲述了一个悲惨故事之后，预示了前途的无限光明，然而这种预言又因<strong>毫无根据</strong>而显得十分空洞。</p>

<blockquote>
<p>在灾难中展现崇高。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>我想到《艾迪芬奇的秘密》里，祖母Edie作为见证了无数子女惨死的唯一幸存者，逐渐开始接受这个诅咒，并且主动为孩子们的死亡打造了童话般的故事。感觉…某种意义上来说也很可爱吧。算不上崇高，但是有这个影子。</p>
<p>看到极左有点Fi爆表。但是我不去写自己，不去用自己的Fi，我写什么小说？我又不是吃这碗饭的。</p>

<ol>
<li>青春疼痛文学，是指描述主人公青春时期的伤痛的文学作品，主要是指的是这个小说或者文章的主人公在青春期的那段时间的伤痛。青春疼痛文学作品一般里面的内容都是包括失恋，堕胎，打架，自杀等等一些比较颓废的事情。</li>
<li>当然这些文学作品大家往往也是青春期的时候比较喜欢看，但是当回过味来会发现这种作品里充斥着“为赋新词强说愁”的感觉，而且作品内容十分不贴合现实，而是为了疼痛而疼痛，所以被称为青春疼痛文学。</li>
<li>现在青春疼痛文学可用来代指那些很矫情、非主流的文字以及大家都有过的那段羞耻的青春期。</li>
<li>现在这个“青春疼痛文学”基本上就是指的那些非主流的文字写出来的一些青春期的文章。罗志祥在520当天的微博上发了一个长文，标题是《男孩，女孩》。这篇长文真的是像极了非主流时期写的文章。所以网友直接调侃，罗志祥是青春疼痛文学的作者。</li>

<h1 id="被窝文学"><a href="#被窝文学" class="headerlink" title="被窝文学"></a>被窝文学</h1><p>【区分romance和erotica】</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simplest way to look at the two is this:<br>Romance novels have the sex scenes revolve around the plot.<br>Erotic fiction has the plot revolve around the sex scenes!<br>So before you start writing erotica, ask yourself whether your story is about the characters and an exciting plot (that just so happens to have the odd steamy scene) – or whether the hot action is what your readers want, and you simply have to thread each sex scene together with a plausible storyline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.23 由暮光之城-》五十度灰-》365days 启发，顺便讨论下“被窝文学”的问题。就，首先是受众问题。先不论逻辑和真实性，有一部分人就是想看lust而不是love，所以即便没有逻辑和真实性，他们也会喜欢看。所以被窝文学即便毫无逻辑毫不真善美也是会有人喜欢的这件事并不奇怪，也没什么好说的。<br>要说的就是作者的问题。<strong>作者是要传达什么信息，从中能看出作者对此的什么态度</strong>才是判断“这本书究竟该不该读”的最核心问题。如果让一个鄙视爱情的人来给你传达（或者说“翻译”）他所认为的爱情观，自然对“想要了解真正的爱情观”的你没有很大帮助。<br>我认为，假设作者其实没有很大的扭曲爱情观，她们之所以<strong>敢</strong>写出这样的作品，是因为她们作为作者，知道男主（攻）最终会爱上女主（受），知道女主（受）最终会爱上男主（攻），而且甚至某种程度上，她们也知道/认为读者知道/认可了这样的既定条件，毕竟这就是同人作品的一个圈内潜规则。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“这对cp一定会以某种方式相互接触到的。毕竟作者打了他们的tag。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>所以才会有“男主绑架女主真的好罗曼蒂克哦”这样的思维趋势，因为在她们看来，这是“攻在主动追求受”，是“注定在一起的人前期的互相打闹”，这就是“imprinting”作为读者脑内一个观念的具现化和功能体现。当然也有所谓的“BE”，就是受和攻最后分手的场合，但无论如何，这一定是“攻和受的故事”。<br>但其实在部分不晓得什么是“同人文化”，不晓得“男女主早已情定终生，因为读者知道作者写的就是这个cp”的圈外人士看来，这就是“犯罪”，因为男女主并没有表现出任何“真实逻辑上可以为（不认同这对cp的）读者提供共情和理解的、相互吸引的条件”，他们的爱情没有任何可信度，也让他们学不到除了“同人文化圈先睹为快”之外的任何东西。<br>在这种情况下，就会让“圈外人士”很崩溃，将其定义为lust，但知道了圈内潜规则的就会认为这是love，因为她们相信最终攻受会向健康的方向发展，前面只是在“虐”而已，后面会发糖的（大概，也不排除一刀到底）。【但是现实生活中（也就是圈外人士一直遵循的模式），我们并不知道伴侣会不会变得健康。】</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“啊他为了和她在一起，都宁可陷入不健康的爱情，他们真的天注定”<br>“…他为了和她在一起，都陷入了不健康的爱情，你告诉我为什么你觉得这样就是天注定”<br>“因为他为了和她在一起，都宁可陷入不健康的爱情，抛弃了健康的爱情”（“因为他们本来就是天注定”，但是不好意思说/没有意识到）<br>“…但不应该是他做出了天注定的行为（真正的love），所以才天注定吗，他为了她都宁可陷入不健康的爱情（lust），这并不健康，并不是天注定的行为，所以这并不是天注定”<br>“你不懂，人是会变的，哪怕现在他们不健康，未来他们也会健康的，因为他们就是天注定”<br>“你怎么知道他们会变健康，你怎么知道他们天注定？”<br>“因为他们就是天注定。因为他为了她宁可陷入不健康的爱情。”<br>“？你有病吧？”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>然后如果作为一个同人女，也就是“圈内人士”来读的时候，之所以会有“啊好罗曼蒂克”的这种反应，我感觉部分也是因为“啊，好虐”这种“现在越虐，后面会越甜”的上帝视角。<br>【其实是因为天注定，所以他们才相爱。没有这个前提，这篇作品就无法继续。但有了这个前提，作品里的一切都会变得浪漫化。】</p>
<p>反正在我来看，这就是作者在交了钱的观众面前自我高潮（是我所很厌恶的）。你fanfic你不收钱你随意，结果你收别人钱然后自我高潮，在一个公开场合完全没有任何自省反思和为他人着想的责任感，就很nm恶心。反正我是这么认为的（乐）。<br>然后就是 那种attempt也让我很恶心，就是那种为自己的春梦辩护，非要给它加进去逻辑性和真实感，从而强行把lust变成love的那种attempt。明明写作原动力就是作者自己的lust（不是写作欲望的lust，而是做爱欲望的lust），还非要升华【确实我也在做这种事情，乐，但我是在探索而不是在升华】，你哪怕原动力是lust，一直维持到最后也是lust，也行；一开始是lust，但是做了love的铺垫，最后变成love，也行；你他妈妈从头到尾都是lust，为了能摆的上市面而强行解释成love？？？你要是从头到尾都是“我就是lust，我就喜欢写黄文，我写的就是黄文，怎么地”我还敬你是条汉子。<br>【就是明明是erotica，非要说自己是romance】</p>
<p>然后我觉得写好被窝一大重点就是写好lust。就是要写好sexual arousement（？）（erotica）。其实就是黄文。<br>emm 我在想我是不是 呃 我怕我写不好这个lust的主题…就，因为我总是觉得做春梦不好 很放纵就很 呃 就和写黄一样，然后我就没怎么考虑过我在lust上的感受，就 呃，没有体验没有幻想就不好写。（看向陛下）（陛下把我视线掰向团长）</p>
<p>用新的视角这么一想就感觉 呃 或许是不知为什么一个erotica的作品被标记为romance 所以才让很多人觉得离谱吧。</p>

<p>也就是erotica<br>emm 我流感觉就是Se要很强吧，就比如，让你写fantasy porn比如龙x龙骑士 或者写医生主题的porn的话，要能意识到这个题哪方面很erotic（在自己没有亲身经历过的情况下）、很“想不到”（就是指这些幻想是读者（或者我）一下子想不到的（？）就是，比如五感之类的），包括概念上、肉体上、氛围上、设定上、环境上，要抓住这些特点细描（不但修辞要棒，文笔（用词之类的表面功夫）也要好），让读者（作者自己）能感受到这个场景，可以旁观也可以身临其境，这样。然后还要声色俱全…当然同时还要结合人物和故事情节来暗喻和润色之类的，，，</p>
<blockquote>
<p>这意味着你不能仅仅报告角色 X 与角色 Y 发生了性关系。你必须让场景在页面上逐个动作地展开。在那里也保留大量对话，使其成为情节的一部分。请记住，有趣的角色互动 = 有趣的性爱。<br>设身处地为他们着想（或内衣），想象他们正在经历什么。调动所有五种感官。他们在想什么？他们有什么感觉？他们能闻到、听到、尝到、看到什么？<br>确保场景和道具反映了故事。如果场景设置在一座 19 世纪的豪宅中，那么他是在撕掉她的丝绸舞会礼服吗？枝形吊灯中的蜡烛会闪烁吗？她是不是一个接一个地摸着手套？<br>或者，如果他们在甜点岛上，他们的嘴里和头发里有沙子吗？他们能听到热带鸟类和海浪拍打的声音吗？暖风是否轻抚着他们赤裸的背脊？</p>

<blockquote>
<p>使用节奏法<br>接下来尝试进入类似于性爱节奏的节奏。<br>慢，慢，快，慢。对，就是那样。就像舞蹈一样。否则你为什么认为跳舞在过去被认为如此大胆？这是人们在公共场合可以接触到的最近的地方。你见过比阿根廷探戈更精心编排的性爱吗？</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>色情浪漫小说不同于情色小说，因为性爱是情节的一部分并推动故事向前发展。对于言情小说，人物和情节是最重要的部分……然后是性。而对于色情作品来说，一切都是关于性和情节的。<br>对于热辣的言情小说，试着把注意力集中在人物身上，他们想要什么，以及与他们所爱的人在一起将如何实现他们的目标。不要为了它而添加性爱场面，确保有一个积累，大量的戏弄，拉扯和推动悬念，然后是一个大高潮（可以说是）。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>感觉有时候感觉恐怖游戏和情色小说差不多….因为这些元素都可以插入任何一个主题中然后将其变得恐怖/色情。或许是因为他们都调动起了最原始的情绪吧。</p>
<p><strong>介绍</strong></p>
<p>您观看的每一部情景喜剧或电影都会以介绍主角开始。色情也不例外。电影可以花 20 分钟来说明主角是谁、他们想要什么、住在哪里以及他们在做什么，而情景喜剧必须在不到一分钟的时间内完成所有这些。色情片段必须在几段中做到这一点。</p>
<p>对于故事的每个片段需要多长时间，没有固定的长度。它需要多长时间才能说出您需要说的内容。所以不要纠结于写作的长度。只要确保你说了需要说的话。请理解，人们阅读色情短片是为了快速实现幻想。他们不需要也不想知道角色的整个人生故事。他们只需要你为他们的幻想搭建舞台，然后继续走向高潮。</p>
<p>以下是您需要在故事的前几段中包含的详细信息： 主要角色的外貌描述。他/她的姓名、位置，也许还有他们的职业。您还需要关联角色的性生活状态。您的主角的性生活中很可能缺少某些东西。他们可能很孤独，只是从前任中走出来，将他们的关系提升到一个新的水平，寻找他们的下一个风流韵事，甚至出于某种原因避免性生活。不管是什么情况，读者都需要知道主角想要什么以及他们对性生活的感受。这使您的角色栩栩如生，使他们更容易产生共鸣，并为他们在故事的其余部分要做的任何事情提供可靠的动力。</p>
<p>如果你的故事开始于你的主角离开家并无缘无故地与某个随机的人发生性关系，你的故事就不会流畅；它甚至可能没有任何意义。进入主角思想的另一个非常重要的原因是因为性与身体一样情绪化。色情作品的一半情色是在探索性的情感方面。为了建立联系，您需要探索角色的想法、欲望、期望、不安全感和反应。</p>
<p>由于每个色情故事都围绕着主角展开，因此您需要写出可信的角色。做到这一点的最好方法是以你自己为主角，让“你”与之发生性关系的人是你真正认识（或至少见过）的人。在撰写初稿时使用真实姓名可能会有所帮助。然后在完成后更改名称。当你写真实的人时，他们会感觉像真实的人，你不必担心凭空捏造每一个细节。当然，由于幻想是对现实生活的夸张，所以您不希望细节完全基于现实。你可以而且应该调整描述、想法和行为以满足幻想的需要（并保护角色所基于的人的真实身份）。</p>
<p><strong>大灾变</strong></p>
<p>一旦你确定了你的主角是谁，他们在生活中所处的位置，他们缺少什么以及他们想要什么，那么你就已经为他们做好了准备。在故事的介绍部分，主角继续过着他们正常的生活。在灾难片段中，主角去了某个地方或遇到了某个人，这为主角提供了实现他们未实现的愿望的机会。</p>
<p>在动作片中，大灾变将是一个激烈的事件，完全颠覆主角的生活轨迹，例如外星人入侵或亲人死亡。在情景喜剧中，灾难将是一个特殊的机会或不便。在色情作品中，你不必太有创意。灾难通常只不过是主角遇到了他们即将与之发生性关系的人。</p>
<p>如果主角已经认识他们将要与之发生性关系的人，那么灾难就需要是一些改变他们关系性质的事件。最简单的编排方法是让其中一个角色抓住机会，第一次或比平时更努力地打击另一个角色。无论发生什么，两个角色都需要有理由去做他们正在做的事情。通常他们走出舒适区的原因通常只是因为他们真的非常饥渴。您可以变得更加哲学化，有时您需要这样做。如果你写的是两个长期处于坚定的 BDSM 关系中的角色，你将需要一个比“我们今天非常饥渴”更好的灾难。所以我们尝试了一些不同的东西。”</p>
<p><strong>决定</strong></p>
<p>你的故事从介绍你的角色开始，然后你的角色发生了一些事情，为实现他们【或作者】的性幻想提供了机会。不用说，您的角色将接受这个机会，但重要的是要告诉读者原因。在主角接受机会的那一刻，你需要进入角色的头脑并解释他们的思考过程。它可能只需要一两句话，原因可能就像角色无法控制的饥渴一样简单，但读者需要知道这一点，以便接下来的事件顺理成章地进行，并让读者完全理解角色他们通过替代生活。没有这个细节，你的故事仍然可以成功，但细节是好故事和伟大故事之间的区别。</p>
<p><strong>前戏</strong></p>
<p>既然你的主角已经被介绍，发现自己面临着实现幻想的机会并决定接受这个机会，现在他们需要抓住这个机会……一步一个脚印。</p>
<p>你不能把你的故事引到两个人决定放开他们的压抑然后立即开始拍打皮肤的性爱。在达到这一点之前，仍然需要采取合乎逻辑的步骤。他们需要互相接触。他们需要接吻。他们需要脱掉衣服。他们需要找到发生性关系的地方和方式。需要有一个场景将他们从他们正在做的事情转变为他们将要做的事情。</p>
<p>故事的这一部分还应该提升故事中的情感和身体能量。如果他们现在就做爱，故事就结束了。读者希望在达到高潮之前被戏弄和唤起。由于您的读者希望被取笑和激起，您的角色需要被取笑和激起。因此，在求爱仪式的这个阶段停留足够长的时间以建立一些性紧张是值得的。让你的角色亲热并抚摸对方，并确保解释主角的感受和他们所处情况的想法。</p>
<p><strong>上升行动#1</strong></p>
<p>一旦你在你的角色还穿着衣服（或至少他们的大部分衣服）时建立了一点性紧张，那么你就为衣服脱落和角色最终得到他们的手做好了准备彼此的肉。通常，这部分故事涉及口交、手淫、指法或您的角色喜欢的任何内容。</p>
<p>你不仅要提升角色之间的肢体动作，还要提升情感方面。告诉读者你的女性角色是湿的或者你的男性角色正在流口水。进入他们的头脑，详细说明他们是多么的高兴，以及他们是如何不敢相信正在发生的事情。告诉读者你的角色多么渴望得到更多。</p>
<p><strong>崛起行动 #2</strong></p>
<p>在你的角色在情感和身体上都处于爆发的边缘之后，你终于可以让他们进行插入式的性爱。详细描述肢体动作。描述一下里面和外面的感觉。使动作进行得越来越快。让角色情绪失控，告诉读者角色的感受和想法。</p>
<p><strong>高潮</strong></p>
<p>故事的高潮是主角高潮。他们可以有多次性高潮。请注意，一旦角色获得性满足，读者也会获得。所以不要打算在此之后的故事中发生太多其他事情。这个故事达到了它的目的。剩下要做的唯一一件事就是结束叙述。</p>
<p>写高潮没有唯一正确的方法。重要的是它对角色来说是合乎逻辑的。你必须问问自己，你和你的角色希望性高潮发生的方式和地点：阴道内、屁股、嘴巴、某人的脸上等。</p>
<p>故事的这一部分不仅仅是关于体液的。这是某人最疯狂的梦想的实现。这是一个会在情感上影响他们的重大场合。花点时间仔细想想这种体验对角色的情感和身体满足程度。说说它如何影响他们。说说这让他们感到多么欣慰和满足。通过角色的行为来说明情感影响。</p>
<p><strong>日落</strong></p>
<p>你的读者不关心你的角色在十年后会在哪里。所以你不需要过多地关注他们生活中性生活后的事件，但与此同时你不能只是用“……然后他高潮了”来结束你的故事。“结束。” 您的读者是人，而人希望叙述能够结束。当整个情节都围绕着性接触展开时，结束叙述就很简单了。你可以让一个角色穿上衣服然后走出门。你可以让你的角色互相拥抱，让他们依偎在余晖中。</p>
<p>故事的结局几乎是自己写的。因为你已经知道你的角色是谁，你只需要让他们做下一个符合逻辑的事情，即那个人在你为他们创造的情况下会做的事情。</p>
<p>就像故事中的所有其他片段一样，仅仅说出角色对他们的身体做了什么是不够的。你需要告诉读者主角对这段经历的想法和感受。它如何改变了他们的内心？它如何改变了他们的生活？这让他们有多开心？这段经历将如何改变他们的生活？他们再次这样做的机会有多大？</p>

<p>呃，突然想到那其实 @Re 的卢是把陛下看做是自己的fetish了（啊</p>
<p>Kink is an umbrella term that encompasses all “alternative” sexual interests—basically anything that’s outside the more common, mainstream forms of sexual activity. Most prominently, this includes all of the aspects of BDSM (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism), but it also includes <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWluZGJvZHlncmVlbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG93LXRvLWhhdmUtYS10aHJlZXNvbWU=">group sex<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWluZGJvZHlncmVlbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvb3Blbi1yZWxhdGlvbnNoaXAtZ3VpZGU=">polyamory<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWluZGJvZHlncmVlbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2hhdC1pcy1jdWNrb2xkaW5n">cuckolding<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, pegging, pony play, “ageplay,” and much more.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, what’s considered “kinky” and “out of the norm” might vary depending on the individual. It’s based primarily on your generation, culture, and religion. For instance, your grandmother might find dildos or doggy style to be a form of kink, while those same things might be considered vanilla（无特色/普通的） and boring to her grandchildren in Gen Z.</p>
<p>A fetish is a very specific requirement, either based in psychology or sensation, that is <strong>necessary for an individual’s sexual arousal and enjoyment</strong>. Fetishes can involve inanimate objects (such as high heels), known as form fetishes, or specific materials (such as leather, silk, or vinyl), known as media fetishes. They can also be focused on specific body parts (like feet or breasts) or even specific types of partners or behaviors.</p>
<p>Many people have some slight fetishistic behaviors—a voluptuous butt, for example, is currently a popularly fetishized body part—but a true fetish is when an object or behavior is <em>required</em> for sexual arousal. A fetishist would typically not be able to experience sexual arousal without it.</p>
<p>The difference between a kink and a fetish:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Kinks are more about exploration and variety, whereas a fetish is a sexual necessity. Oftentimes, kinks overlap with fetishes, but what separates the two depends on whether the behavior or item is required for sexual arousal. These days kink is used to spice things up. By increasing sexual excitement, kink can be used to also enhance the intimacy of the experience. Many couples engaging in kink don’t need the behavior to enjoy sex; instead, kink stands to increase the connection that’s already present. For instance, a person who enjoys spanking their partner during sex may use a hand or riding crop to do so. It isn’t necessarily the spanking itself or the object being used that increases excitement but rather enjoying using them with their partner. This same couple may incorporate a blindfold as a form of sensory deprivation and receive the same kind of enjoyment the next time.Kink is something used to enhance sex, but it isn’t a requirement for it. A fetishist, on the other hand, may <em>always</em> need their interest to be included in sexual play in order to get adequately aroused.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Kink is an umbrella term. Kinks and fetishes often overlap. Most fetishes are kinks, though not all kinks are fetishes. For example, a leather fetish is also a form of kink. But spanking or cuckolding might be a form of kink that someone enjoys but not necessarily a fetish, insofar as it’s not <em>necessary</em> for their sexual pleasure.</p>

<li><p>Some fetishes are problematic or dangerous. Fetishes can sometimes be more extreme and disruptive due to the constant requirement of their fetish for sexual pleasure. For example, someone with a serious foot fetish might need to constantly <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWluZGJvZHlncmVlbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG93LXRvLWRlYWwtd2hlbi15b3VyLXBhcnRuZXJzLWZhbnRhc3ktdHVybnMteW91LW9mZmhvdy10by1zdGF5LW9wZW4td2hlbi15b3VyLXBh">look for partners who are game<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> for foot play for them to have a satisfying sexual life; in such a case, their fetish might become a dominant part of that person’s life and identity. (This might be different from someone with a big breast fetish, on the other hand, who will have much less trouble finding sexual experiences that cater to that.)Some fetishes can even be dangerous, whether for the fetishist or the object of their desires. For instance, someone with a voyeurism fetish (aka <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cDovL2phYXBsLm9yZy9jb250ZW50LzQyLzIvMTkx">voyeuristic disorder<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>) needs to spy intentionally on unsuspecting people to become sexually aroused. Someone who can only be aroused by children (aka <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cDovL2phYXBsLm9yZy9jb250ZW50LzQyLzIvMTkx">pedophilic disorder<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>) also has a clearly problematic fetish. Both of these fetishes don’t allow for consent and cause clear harm to others if acted on.Some fetishists will seek psychological treatment when they find their fetishes interfere with their relationships or cross over into illegal territory. However, most fetishes are not illegal. The more disruptive cases may be diagnosed with <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmF2aXZlLmNvbS90aGVyYXBlZGlhL2ZldGlzaGlzdGljLWRpc29yZGVyLWRzbS0tNS0zMDIuODEtKGY2NS4wKQ==">fetishistic disorder<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, which involves having a fetish that causes distress or impairment to the individual or harm to others.</p>

<p>“Kink is something that one may or may not include in their sexual behavior as a way to enhance pleasure and subjective experience. </p>
<p>A fetish is something that primarily defines and is inextricably linked to one’s sexual behavior,” says Zrenchik. A fetish is typically concentrated on an object or a body part, i.e., latex, leather, or feet, whereas a kink could be an action, sex act, behavior, or even dynamic between partners. </p>
<p>Fetishes are often all-encompassing and the focal point of a person’s erotic life. A person with a foot fetish, for instance, would not just derive extra pleasure from touching, licking, or seeing feet during sex; instead, they may <em>only</em> want to interact sexually with feet to the exclusion of other things. </p>
<p>“They may not engage in any penetrative act at all but will still draw sexual gratification from the act [of interacting with feet],” says Zrenchik. Outside of sex, the word “fetish” is also used to describe a type of object that’s conferred magical powers, and that’s how you can think of it in reference to sex. Some people have objects or body parts that are sexually enticing to them and hold power over them in a way that is out of “the ordinary.” Sex therapist <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGl5YWhtb29yZS5jb20v">Aliyah Moore, Ph.D.,<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> says you can differentiate between the two using this simple quiz:</p>
<ol>
<li>Am I aroused by a thing or an action?</li>
<li>Do I need it to be present to be aroused?</li>
<li>Can I enjoy solo sex without it being present?</li>
</ol>

<p>**“sexually-provocative behavior”,**“participation in or taste for uncommon sexual conduct”,</p>
<p>**“any kind of non-traditional sexual practices, concepts or fantasies”,**“something opposite to vanilla sex”,</p>
<p>**“openness to sexual experiments”,*<em>“sexual practices that most people consider to be wild, unusual or extreme”</em></p>
<p>Using that list, one can single out a single basic thing that all definitions have in common: at the very least, a kink is something that ignites sexual desire.</p>
<h2 id="一些术语"><a href="#一些术语" class="headerlink" title="一些术语"></a>一些术语</h2><h2 id="Limits"><a href="#Limits" class="headerlink" title="Limits"></a>Limits</h2><p>Consent is paramount in kink. If you’re just getting started, or want to slowly introduce BDSM into an existing relationship, both you and your partner should make a list of your soft and hard limits. A soft limit is something that you’re curious about yet unsure if it’s right for you, such as name-calling. A hard limit is something that you are certain is off-limits, such as electrostimulation. Writing out your hard and soft limits with a partner is a wonderful way to get to know another side of each other. Along with implementing limits, it’s important to choose a safeword that is not <em>no</em> or <em>stop,</em> because some couples use such language as a part of their role play. Your hard and soft limits will likely evolve the more you explore, so it’s important to keep having these conversations with your partner.</p>

While you might refer to a night of sex as simply a hook-up, those within the kink community often referred to planned time with partners, in which they engage in their shared kinks, as “scenes.”</p>
<h2 id="Dominant-and-submissive"><a href="#Dominant-and-submissive" class="headerlink" title="Dominant and submissive"></a>Dominant and submissive</h2><p>A dominant is someone who enjoys <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29zbW9wb2xpdGFuLmNvbS9zZXgtbG92ZS9wb3NpdGlvbnMvZzI4ODQ1NTUzL2RvbWluYW50LWJkc20tc2V4LXBvc2l0aW9ucy8=">dominating their partner<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> through various kinky activities. <strong>These can be physical—like choking—or mental—like calling someone names</strong>. The submissive partner enjoys being dominated, and being the one who is consensually tied up, slapped, or humiliated.</p>
<p>“Usually when we hear people use terms like ‘dominant’ or ‘submissive’ to describe themselves, these are more identity-based than action-based,” <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9CbGtHaXJsTWFuaWZlc3Q=">Cameron Glover<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, sex educator and <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9zZXhlZGluY29sb3Iv">Sex Ed in Color<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> podcast host, explains. “But these don’t have to be set in stone—there are people that use these terms interchangeably.”</p>

<h2 id="Sadism-and-masochism"><a href="#Sadism-and-masochism" class="headerlink" title="Sadism and masochism"></a>Sadism and masochism</h2><p>A sadist is someone who (consensually) <strong>derives sexual pleasure out of inflicting physical pain or psychological humiliation on their partner</strong>. Masochism, or someone who identifies as a masochist, is someone who <strong>derives sexual pleasure out of *receiving* pain or humiliation</strong>. If this feels similar to the dominant and submissive dynamic, that’s because it is. But not all dominants identify as sadists, and the same goes for submissives and masochists.</p>
<h2 id="Edge-Play"><a href="#Edge-Play" class="headerlink" title="Edge Play"></a>Edge Play</h2><p>“Edge play in kink is any kind of activity that is further out there and considered more dangerous,” Dr. Powell says. <strong>What qualifies as edge play is different for everyone.</strong> It could mean anything that involves blood or breaking the skin with certain whips, and there are others who enjoy knife and needle play. For some, golden showers may be a regular part of their routine, but for others, that counts as edge play. Dr. Powell says that anything involving intense physical pain is <em>typically</em> considered edge play, but sometimes in kink, the most intense scenes involve only <em>psychological</em> edge play.</p>
<h2 id="RACK"><a href="#RACK" class="headerlink" title="RACK"></a>RACK</h2><p>RACK is not a kink, even though it sounds like on<strong>e. It stands for “risk aware consensual kink,”</strong> and is the most common guideline kinksters live by to make sure all parties are safe. There’s another acronym, SSC, which stands for safe, sane, and consensual, but RACK is used more commonly, since what’s considered “sane” varies so drastically from one person to the next.</p>
<p>The idea of RACK is not that you find a way to eliminate all risks, but that you consider holistically all of the risks that might come up or be involved, Dr. Powell explains, and “then decide how you want to manage those and if that is a risk that feels good for you.”</p>
<h2 id="Aftercare（幕间（x））"><a href="#Aftercare（幕间（x））" class="headerlink" title="Aftercare（幕间（x））"></a>Aftercare（幕间（x））</h2><p><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29zbW9wb2xpdGFuLmNvbS9zZXgtbG92ZS9hMzA0NDM2MzMvYWZ0ZXJjYXJlLWJkc20v">Aftercare<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> isn’t technically a kink, but it’s another word that anyone engaging in kinky play needs to know. It’s basically <strong>a fancy word for checking in with one another after a scene to make sure all parties feel happy and comfortable</strong> with what happened. “It can include cleaning up the space you were in, putting away any toys that were used, and checking in on each other’s mental space,” Dr. Powell says. If anything about the scene felt off or you didn’t like, it’s also a great time to discuss that and make sure the next time is better.</p>
<h2 id="24-7"><a href="#24-7" class="headerlink" title="24/7"></a>24/7</h2><p>While people may generally identify as a submissive or dominant, some partners take it to the next level and enter <strong>a 24/7 arrangement, meaning that the consensual power exchange occurs full time, often while living together</strong>. The dominant and submissive roles are not only taken on for a scene, which may last just a few hours, but literally full time, on a 24/7 basis.</p>

<h2 id="1-Role-Play"><a href="#1-Role-Play" class="headerlink" title="1. Role Play"></a>1. Role Play</h2><p>【OK】</p>
<p>Role-playing is one of the most common kinks and involves <strong>playing characters outside of your day-to-day lives</strong>, usually as part of a sex scene. This can range from tossing on a tie and pretending to be the boss of your partner, <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29zbW9wb2xpdGFuLmNvbS9zZXgtbG92ZS9hMzI0NjQ1NjAvcm9sZS1wbGF5LXNleC1zY2VuZXMtdHYv">channeling your favorite TV character<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, or even creating a whole, character-filled scenario.</p>
<p>Role playing is another common kink, which involves people taking on characters outside of their day-to-day lives as part of a sex scene. This can be as simple as putting on a nurse’s outfit or as elaborate as constructing an entire scene complete with character development. Common examples include doctor and patient (medical role play), boss and secretary, pool boy and rich housewife, or college student and professor. While role playing often comes with costumes and is a fabulous excuse to dress up, an extensive wardrobe is not required. Scenes can be created through dirty talk and pure imagination.</p>
<p>Many sexual kinks and fetishes can fall under the umbrella of scene play, explains Queen, since many people in the BDSM community center their kinky activities within a scene. A scene is a preplanned story including roles that you and your partner will commit to during foreplay and/ or actual sex, think: school teacher and naughty student.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a kink or a fetish, objectification means “arousal by being dehumanized,” explains Rogue. For example, <strong>someone who wants to be used as a sex doll</strong> or as a sex object would have an objectification kink (or fetish, if that’s the only way they can get off). It’s important to note this is different than an objectum kink or fetish. People with objectum fantasies have sexual relationships (or attraction to) inanimate objects.</p>
<h2 id="3-Pregnancy-Fetish"><a href="#3-Pregnancy-Fetish" class="headerlink" title="3. Pregnancy Fetish"></a>3. Pregnancy Fetish</h2><p>【？】</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a pregnancy fetish is having an intense <strong>sexual attraction to some or all aspects of pregnancy.</strong> For some people, it might be the round belly, whereas for other, it could be the lactation—whether it’s the actual act of breastfeeding or the milk itself—explains Adams.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that orgasms and having sex near a due date may help induce labor, there are also those with outright pregnancy fetishes: sexual attraction to a pregnant person. Some partners may indeed discover they have one when their partner is expecting, but others are attracted to the rotund pregnant belly regardless of whose body or baby it is. Since, by that same strict definition mentioned before, a fetish is attraction to an object or body part, pregnancy fetishists go wild for the sight of a swollen, round belly. The attraction may also include an interest in lactation, or other symptoms of pregnancy, but such is not automatically a part of the label.</p>

And while the pleasure is most commonly derived from watching others, the fetish could also include hearing others engage in sexual acts or even being told about other people’s sexual experiences.</p>
<p>A voyeur is someone who derives sexual pleasure from watching others get it on. When we speak about voyeurism from a kink perspective, we’re talking about <em>consensual</em> voyeurism. Very important distinction! Exhibitionists enjoy being watched, and voyeurs enjoy watching, which makes these two kinks a common item on the menu at sex parties or kink events. Things become more confusing in everyday life, because observing someone without their knowledge or consent is absolutely not okay. If you have voyeuristic fantasies, make sure you’re indulging them consensually with willing exhibitionists. That way everyone wins (and gets off).</p>

<h2 id="6-Foot-Fetish"><a href="#6-Foot-Fetish" class="headerlink" title="6. Foot Fetish"></a>6. Foot Fetish</h2><p>【洗过脚就行】</p>

People with foot fetishes may be submissives, meaning they have a <strong>desire to “worship” at someone’s feet</strong> through kissing and massage or by even giving a pedicure, Dr. Powell explains. Other people enjoy an aspect of humiliation and want to be stomped on or have smelly feet on their faces.</p>
<p>Foot fetishes are <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8zOTAxNTQ3">one of the most common<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> fetishes out there, especially for heterosexual men. Someone with a foot fetish is literally turned on by feet—thinking about them, touching them, seeing them—and could potentially get off on everything feet. They often want to engage in foot worship, in which they treat their partner’s foot like a holy object: kissing, caressing, and massaging it. So even if you don’t have a foot fetish, having a partner with one can be extremely enjoyable as it means there could be foot massages galore in store for you. But like all kinks, foot fetishes exist on a spectrum. Humiliation can also play a strong role in a foot fetish: The fetishist may want feet shoved in their face and mouth, or to have their partner walk all over them, touting how filthy their feet are and how pathetic the fetishist is to enjoy such an activity. Other foot fetish activities include giving pedicures and smelling the feet or shoes that said feet reside in throughout the day.</p>

<p>Going <strong>hand-in-hand with foot fetishes</strong>, a nylon fetish is—you guessed it—someone who needs nylons to feel arousal. This could mean you like the look and feel of them or like touching someone’s legs in nylon stockings (or like to wear them yourself). Like with most fetishes, this could also be a kink if it’s something you don’t <em>need</em>, but kinda like. Either way, get yourself some stockings and get to playing.</p>
<p>A nylon fetish—yep, as in tights—often accompanies a foot fetish. One with a nylon fetish may enjoy the look and feeling of toes, feet, and legs wrapped tightly in nylon stockings. They may want to smell the nylons, or have them shoved in their mouth. if you want to try it, start by wearing nylons next time you get frisky (assuming you don’t mind tearing them), or have your partner tie you up with them or use them as a blindfold for sensory deprivation. (Side note: While bondage is a kink, using nylons for bondage is separate from having a nylon fetish, in which the nylons themselves produce the sexual arousal, rather than their usage.)</p>

A healthier, better alternative: Holding your own breath. Not only do you get to experience breath play, but you’re completely in control of when you choose or not to breathe. The excitement of the action, plus the excitement of the power exchange, is a great alternative, suggests <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9nb29kdmliZXNibG9nLmNvbS8=">Good Vibrations<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> sexologist Carol Queen, PhD.</p>
<h2 id="9-BDSM"><a href="#9-BDSM" class="headerlink" title="9.BDSM"></a>9.BDSM</h2><p>【OK？】</p>

<p>Despite what the movie would have you believe, there’s no research that suggests dominants enjoy D.S. activities, such as spanking their partner, due to childhood trauma. And nope, you do <em>not</em> have to sign any sort of contract—all you need is enthusiastic consent from all parties involved.</p>
<h2 id="10-E-Is-for-Electrostimulation"><a href="#10-E-Is-for-Electrostimulation" class="headerlink" title="10. E Is for Electrostimulation"></a>10. E Is for Electrostimulation</h2><p>【？（主要是团里没有电系的…呃，莫诺蒙也不在团里）】</p>
<p>Electrostimulation involves using the power of electricity—i.e., getting an electric shock—for kinky, sexy fun. Obviously, getting shocked can be dangerous, so electrostimulation begins to get into another type of kink called edge play, which refers to risky BDSM behavior that runs the potential of doing actual bodily harm. Electrostimulation is part of CBT (cock and ball torture) sessions in which a domme shocks her sub’s genitals by rigging them to electrical contraptions—typically either a wand (see <em>Z</em> on this list) or a system that stimulates nerve endings called a transcutaneous electrical nerve endings stimulation unit—that can be purchased from specialty kink shops. This is one of those preferences for which you need to be <em>extremely</em> careful to take the correct safety precautions, use an ironclad safeword, and obtain continuous, enthusiastic consent.</p>
<p><em>Zapper</em> is a cute nickname for an <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RvY2tyb29tLmNvbS9raW5rbGFiLW5lb24td2FuZC1yLTkwZGVncmVlLWVsZWN0cm9kZS5odG1s">electro-wand<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> that is used as part of electrostimulation. These typically look like a magic wand that a wizard would use, except they’re used to send shocks to the body. Zappers are frequently used as part of D.S. play in which the dominant shocks the submissive. Though it sounds scary, zappers feel like a little sting. Still it is 100% okay if they’re on your hard-no limit list. You can still be kinky and cool without zappers—I’d be shocked (shocked!) if they didn’t scare you a teeny bit.</p>
<h2 id="11-G-Is-for-Gagging"><a href="#11-G-Is-for-Gagging" class="headerlink" title="11. G Is for Gagging"></a>11. G Is for Gagging</h2><p>【…?】</p>
<p>Gagging refers to lightly choking on an object to the point of making gagging sounds. Often people with penises will get off on their partner gagging on them—and the knowledge that they’re big enough to induce gagging noises. Likewise, the partner going downtown may enjoy having something thrust far enough down their throat that they start to gag. It doesn’t necessarily take a giant object to induce gagging—something smaller can do the trick too. However, if gagging becomes uncomfortable or if you feel like you’re going to throw up (if that’s not something you <em>want</em> to do), you should stop at any point you feel even a little bit off. Remember, kink is all about continuous consent and what makes you feel your sexiest.</p>
<h2 id="12-K-Is-for-Klismaphilia"><a href="#12-K-Is-for-Klismaphilia" class="headerlink" title="12. K Is for Klismaphilia"></a>12. K Is for Klismaphilia</h2><p>【呃，只要不是我，但还是，呕】</p>
<p><em>Klismaphilia</em>（灌肠） is a glamorous Greek word that means “arousal by enemas.” If you’re not familiar, an enema is a medical device that squirts water slightly warmer than body temperature into your anus. It’s used by hospitals to relieve people of constipation or to prep for certain medical procedures. (Not quite as glamorous as the Greek word makes it sound.) This particular kink generally refers to receiving pleasure from <em>receiving</em> an enema, although there are those who get off on administering enemas as well. The anus is an erogenous zone, after all, which helps explain why kinky folks have been using enemas for pleasure forever. This kink can also be quite practical—it’s a way to clean and prep the rectum for anal sex.</p>

<p>Objectum sexuality—a.k.a. a fetish—refers to a sexual relationship (or attraction to) an inanimate object. The <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9qZXplYmVsLmNvbS81MTQ2NjY2L29iamVjdHVtLXNleHVhbGl0eS13aGVuLXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHMtd2l0aC1pbmFuaW1hdGUtb2JqZWN0cy1iZWNvbWUtaW50aW1hdGU=">media frequently portray<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> objectum sexuals as freaks and weirdos falling in love with things such as the Eiffel Tower, a boat, or their couch. However, such an understanding of objectum sexuality is limited. By literal definition, a fetish—any fetish—is an attraction to an inanimate object. This includes lingerie, feet, and sex toys, so if you’ve ever fantasized about your vibrator, welcome to the world of fetish. In fact, in the age of rapidly advancing sex-doll technology, we may all soon be a little bit engaged in objectum sexuality. Such perspective is crucial because it helps us understand and empathize with those who do catch feelings for more “out-there” objects, because kink-shaming sucks.</p>

Golden showers specifically refer to peeing on a partner, as Glover explains. “So beyond golden showers, piss play (also called ‘urophilia’) can include peeing on or in different body parts, clothes wetting, or making a partner hold in their pee as part of the scene play,” Glover says.</p>

Q Is for Quirofilia（恋手癖）</h2><p>A specific fetish for hands is referred to as quirofilia, which may manifest as an attraction to fingers, a great manicure, or simply some smoking hot hands. Hands are sexy. They’re used for myriad sexy things, like the underrated hand job, fingering, and back massages. While quirofilia can absolutely use hand jobs, fisting, or fingering (use of hands to directly create sexual pleasure), some hand fetishists might get off on hands doing mundane tasks, such as picking up groceries or doing chores. While fetishes are inherently sexual, many times the activity or object the fetishist is interested in may present itself as nonsexual in nature. What is one person’s chore, such as washing dishes, is a hand fetishist’s wet dream.</p>

<h2 id="17-Erotic-humiliation-degradation"><a href="#17-Erotic-humiliation-degradation" class="headerlink" title="17. Erotic humiliation/degradation"></a>17. Erotic humiliation/degradation</h2><p>【只要不是我】</p>
<p>Like most kinks, <strong>erotic humiliation exists on a spectrum</strong>. It can mean a dominant partner consensually calling their submissive partner names like “slut” during sex. It can also be as extreme as someone being consensually “forced” to watch their partner have sex with someone else in front of them.</p>
<p>Not all BDSM acts are physical. “Intense language as a use of force can be just as intense, or even more intense, as consensually degrading physical sensations, such as impact play,” Horn says. A common example of humiliation is name-calling and verbal abuse. One of the most common misconceptions about humiliation play is that it’s antifeminist. But the truth is, many feminists enjoy being called names such as “bitch,” “slut,” or “whore” in bed—your kinks are not your values. In a patriarchal world where women have long been told sex is not for pleasure, addressing what gets you off—especially if it’s nontraditional like humiliation—and then engaging it can be a powerful way to take control of your sexuality. As always, discuss humiliation beforehand and keep it consensual. Your partner may be okay with being called a “slut” but not a “bitch,” so be sure to define your boundaries.</p>
<p>A degradation kink can be considered the opposite of a praise kink. A person with this kink is turned on by being denigrated and degraded by their partner either through words or through actions (i.e., being spit on). This kink might do something for you if you lean toward being submissive and like your partner to take control and tell you what to do in a sexual situation.</p>
<h2 id="18-Cuckolding"><a href="#18-Cuckolding" class="headerlink" title="18. Cuckolding"></a>18. Cuckolding</h2><p>【只要不是我…wait】</p>
<p>Cuckolding is a form of the aforementioned erotic humiliation of watching your partner have sex with someone else. And yes, <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29zbW9wb2xpdGFuLmNvbS9zZXgtbG92ZS9hMjY0MjY0MzUvY3Vjay1tZWFuaW5nLWRlZmluaXRpb24v">it’s where the term “cuck” came from<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. <strong>A cuck is a submissive who identities as male and gets off on his partner having sex with someone else</strong>, usually a more “traditionally” masculine person. Sometimes the cuck will watch from the corner of the room. Sometimes the cuck will be verbally mocked for having a smaller penis while their partner has sex with someone else, and sometimes the cuck is forced to stay at home, getting off on the knowledge that their partner is out having sex with someone bigger and stronger than them.</p>
<p>“Traditionally, cuckolding is when a heterosexual couple agrees to both explore the turn-on of the female sleeping with other men and humiliating her male partner about the fact that she’s sleeping with someone else,” says Horn. The male partner need not be present—perhaps he gets off on the mere thought of his partner having sex with someone else. For others, there’s an element of voyeurism to the cuckolding as well. This kink isn’t just for heterosexual couples—people of all genders and orientations can enjoy cuckolding varieties. If you’re turned on by the idea of your partner sleeping with others yet don’t necessarily want to go through the emotional tax and risk of them literally having sex with others, you can explore this kink through dirty talk or virtual sex with a third party.</p>

<p>First let’s get one thing straight: You can’t have sex with an actual octopus or octopus-like monster—octopuses are animals and therefore cannot give consent. But octopus-like monsters totally exist in tentacle porn, which <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2xhbW91ci5jb20vc3RvcnkvZXZlcnl0aGluZy10by1rbm93LWFib3V0LXRlbnRhY2xlLXBvcm4=">you can absolutely watch<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> and get off on. It’s hot, not only because it’s so foreign and forbidden but, according to some experts, because it fulfills some other pretty classic fantasy tropes, like bondage and multiple penetration. And if your ideal penis is actually a giant blue tentacle, the sex toy manufacturer <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9iYWQtZHJhZ29uLmNvbS8=">Bad Dragon<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> just may help you fulfill your monster fantasies.</p>

<p>Most people hear “CBT” and think of cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of therapy that focuses on regulating emotional responses and developing helpful coping mechanisms. But in the world of kink, <strong>CBT refers to cock and ball torture</strong>. It’s fairly self-explanatory, and usually involves a dominatrix inflicting consensual pain on a submissive’s genitals: think stepping on testicles while wearing heels, punching and slapping the penis, or “forcing” penis-having submissives to wear an uncomfortable chastity device.</p>
<h2 id="21-Impact-play（物理伤害）"><a href="#21-Impact-play（物理伤害）" class="headerlink" title="21. Impact play（物理伤害）"></a>21. Impact play（物理伤害）</h2><p>【OK？】</p>
<p>Usually done by a dominant to a submissive,<strong><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29zbW9wb2xpdGFuLmNvbS9zZXgtbG92ZS9hMjUwNjkzOTcvaW1wYWN0LXBsYXkv"> impact play refers to hitting or spanking a partner’s body<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></strong>. Spanking is a common form of impact play, and others enjoy using toys like crops, paddles, or whips. During impact play, To keep impact play safe and comfortable, most partners decide on a “safe word” to stop at any time, agree to only hit fatty areas (like the butt or thighs) to lessen pain, agree to be communicative about any discomfort or unwanted pain, and communicate during the scene to make sure the submissive is okay with the pain level.</p>
<p>Impact play refers to the use of hands, paddles, whips, or whatever you have around your house (spatulas work great) to hit the body. If you’ve ever playfully spanked your partner during sex, that’s impact play. More than anything else, impact play requires consent and communication. A good rule to keep in mind: If you’re the one providing the impact, stick to areas that are fatty, such as the side of the butt or thighs, and avoid anywhere organs reside, such as the kidneys (lower back) or rib cage. As with any new kink, start small, start slow, and choose a safeword. Impact play can be done alone yet also pairs well with other kinks, such as name-calling and age play. If you’re new to the idea, start with your hands and some good old-fashioned spanking before spending money on more heavy-duty whips and floggers. If anything becomes uncomfortable (and not in a good way), implement your safeword immediately.</p>
<h2 id="22-Whip"><a href="#22-Whip" class="headerlink" title="22. Whip"></a>22. <em>Whip</em></h2><p>【只要不是我】</p>
<p><em>Whip</em> is commonly used as an umbrella term for all impact play tools, though it technically refers to an item with a thinner body that produces more of a “stingy” sensation. (You’ll often hear BDSM practitioners refer to sensations as either stingy or thuddy—the latter describing a toy like a paddle.) The most advanced whip on the market is the <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cDovL3d3dy53ZXN0ZXJud2hpcHMuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXdoaXAtd3Nnbi5qcGc=">single-tail<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, which looks like a snake and can create a cracking noise when used correctly. Single-tails break the skin and can wrap around the body, injuring areas where organs reside, and should only be used by professional dominatrices with years of experience. Even some pro dominatrices will use them only for intimidation, rather than to actually impact their submissive’s body. If you want to try a whip, opt for a beginner-friendly option.</p>

<h2 id="23-Age-play"><a href="#23-Age-play" class="headerlink" title="23. Age play"></a>23. Age play</h2><p>【？】</p>
<p>This is just a concise term for a form of role-playing in which <strong>two consenting adults enter a scene that involves taking on roles and ages that aren’t their own.</strong> This can simply mean a submissive enjoying a partner who takes care of them and who they call “mommy” or “daddy,” but it can go as far as playing an adult baby and indulging in diaper play.</p>
<p>Age play is a form of role play in which one or both partners pretend to be (and get off on being) an age other than their own. Chances are you’ve already experienced what could be considered ultra-lite age play if you’ve ever called a partner “baby” in bed. Another common example is the “daddy dominant–baby girl” setup. If you’re calling someone “daddy” in bed, you’re engaging in light age play. A more extreme and less common example of age play is full-on role playing wherein one partner is turned on by wearing a diaper and acting like a baby. Calling someone “baby” or dressing up like one is totally okay if everyone involved is into it. “It involves consent of all involved,” explains sex therapist <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cDovL2Rhdmlkb3J0bWFubi5jb20v">David Ortmann<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, author of <em><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TZXh1YWwtT3V0c2lkZXJzLVVuZGVyc3RhbmRpbmctU2V4dWFsaXRpZXMtQ29tbXVuaXRpZXMvZHAvMTQ0MjIxNzM2Ny9yZWY9c3JfMV8xP290cz0xJnNsb3ROdW09MCZpbXByVG9rZW49ZWFjMmY2NzAtYjA3Yi0wZmQwLTY5MCZ0YWc9Z2xhbW91cjBkNy0yMCZsaW5rQ29kZT13NTAmaWU9VVRGOCZxaWQ9MTUxMzc5NzMzMSZzcj04LTEma2V5d29yZHM9U2V4dWFsK091dHNpZGVyczorVW5kZXJzdGFuZGluZytCRFNNK1NleHVhbGl0aWVzK2FuZCtDb21tdW5pdGllcw==">Sexual Outsiders: Understanding BDSM Sexualities and Communities<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></em>.

People who in general find themselves drawn to breasts might find they have a nipple kink. Tweak, lick, and bite your partner’s nipples or invite them to do so to yours in order to discover if this is the kink for you. And remember, nipple play is for everyone, not just women.

People with an FLR kink are turned on by giving the woman in a heterosexual relationship the bulk of the sexual control. This could look like sex centering on her pleasure or her deciding when and how sex should be had.

<h2 id="32-Financial-domination"><a href="#32-Financial-domination" class="headerlink" title="32. Financial domination"></a>32. Financial domination</h2><p>【？】</p>
<p>Financial domination, aka FinDom, is often a fetish but can also be a kink. It involves giving over total control of one’s finances to someone else or being kept on a strict budget or being ordered to purchase certain things. This kink is for you if the idea of giving over so much control in such an important part of life turns you on. You can explore it by beginning with a trusted partner and introducing a financial element into your sex life. For instance, one could say that 10% of your monthly income must be spent on <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWluZGJvZHlncmVlbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmVzdC1zZXgtdG95cy1mb3Itd29tZW4=">sexy presents<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> for your partner and go from there.</p>

For example, you might be extra aroused by hearing the sound of your partner hit against you as you have sex, or the sound of their moans or how wet they are. You can explore this kink by trying to dampen out other senses, by using a blindfold for instance, so you can focus on the noises. If you’ve ever gotten tingly listening to ASMR or the sound effects in <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWluZGJvZHlncmVlbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2hhdC1pcy1hdWRpby1lcm90aWNhLXBsdXMtMTAtcGxhY2VzLXlvdS1jYW4tbGlzdGVuLXRvLWl0">audio erotica<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, this might be your kink.</p>

<p>Consensual nonconsent is a kink in which someone is turned on by the idea of being “taken” by their partner while they pretend to say no. Sometimes referred to as a “rape fantasy,” this kink is always pre-agreed-on and must be carefully negotiated by all parties involved. “There is evidence that people who have experienced sexual assault can find this type of scene healing because they get to have some control over it, but there are many people who have not experienced sexual trauma who enjoy it as well,” says sex coach <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVhaGNhcmV5LmNvbS8=">Leah Carey<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.</p>
<h2 id="34-Praise-kink"><a href="#34-Praise-kink" class="headerlink" title="34. Praise kink"></a>34.

People who are a little unsure of themselves or who struggle with <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWluZGJvZHlncmVlbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYXR0YWNobWVudC1pc3N1ZXM=">attachment issues<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> may be particularly into this kink.</p>

<p>Blood play is all about being aroused by blood, either by having your own brought to the surface or drawing your partner’s blood, says <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9zZXh0aGVyYXB5aGF3YWlpLmNvbS9hYm91dC1kci1sb3JpLWxhd3Jlbnov">Lori Lawrenz, Psy.D.,<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> a clinical psychologist with a specialization in sexual health. A blood kink might speak to people who are turned on by vampires or those who enjoy inflicting or receiving pain (sadists and masochists). Make sure to use well-sterilized objects to draw blood, have a safe word, and preferably take a class from an experienced domme who can show you how to indulge this kink safely.</p>

<p>Known in everyday speech as a “furry kink,” autoplushophilia “involves dressing up in animal costumes and engaging in sexual play,” explains Lawrenz. A furry is someone who is turned on by imagining themselves and others as anthropomorphic animals. “As a sexual practice, this is often a very fun way to connect with your partner. If you like to dress up or have a huge stuffed animal collection—this kink may be for you,” says Lawrenz.</p>

<p>Somnophilia, sometimes referred to as sleeping beauty syndrome, is defined as getting arousal from a person who is seemingly asleep or unconscious.</p>
<p>This kind of fetish also involves an exchange of power, where the person awake is in a dominant position. However, it should always be approached with consent, as should all sexual kinks and fetishes, says McDevitt. “All should be approached with informed consent. Everyone should be sober. Everyone should know what to expect, and trust that acting on these kinks can be stopped anytime, for any reason.”</p>
<h2 id="39-Katoptronphilia（镜子）"><a href="#39-Katoptronphilia（镜子）" class="headerlink" title="39. Katoptronphilia（镜子）"></a>39. Katoptronphilia（镜子）</h2><p>【只要不是我】</p>
<p>A fascination with mirrors, or more specifically, watching yourself in sexual situations is known as katoptronphilia.</p>
<p>“People who like this kind of play may have a mirror by their bed, or masturbate to their own mirror image,” explains Queen. In other words, katoptronphilia essentially means you enjoy having sex in front of a mirror. To bring katoptonphilia into your bedroom, make sure you have your partner’s consent and be sure to be strategic about where you place your mirrors, so you can catch the best glimpses of yourself.</p>
<p>Like many, this practice is often portrayed in porn, but Queen says it’s important that porn isn’t your only guide to new activity. “Porn is not intended to be how-to material, unless it is clearly advertised as such. There is [however] a small but significant genre of what I call ‘ex-ed,’ explicit educational movies.” If you want to learn more, reach out to a sex therapist or read up on materials written by them.</p>
<h2 id="40-Sensation-Play"><a href="#40-Sensation-Play" class="headerlink" title="40. Sensation Play"></a>40. Sensation Play</h2><p>【OK】</p>
<p>“The one overarching thing often said about kink is that it is erotic play that includes the whole body, not just the genitals,” Queen explains. “Sensation play can definitely include the genitals, but it is also common to engage parts of the body we don’t think of as erogenous zones–like the back.”</p>
<p>In sensation play, there’s a focus on the body and the many sensate experiences we can have, so flogging, massage, temperature play involving ice cubes or candles that melt at a lower temperature, tickling and other kinky play can all fall under the category of sensation play.</p>
<h2 id="41-Vorarephilia（食人）"><a href="#41-Vorarephilia（食人）" class="headerlink" title="41. Vorarephilia（食人）"></a>41. Vorarephilia（食人）</h2><p>【只要不是我，最好也不要是陛下】</p>
<p>Vorarephilia is often shortened to “vore,” and can also entail fantasies about eating someone or watching someone being eaten, chewed, or swallowed whole.</p>
<p>This cannibalism-influenced sexual interest involves getting eaten alive—“usually being consumed whole and live by a much larger person or creature,” Lehmiller explains. “There’s often also a BDSM element to that interest as well, in that there’s often this predator/prey scenario and a lot of themes of dominance and submission.”</p>
<p>People might indulge this niche inclination through role-play or through watching (simulated) live-action or animated vore porn, an increasingly popular adult subgenre.</p>
<h2 id="42-Macrophilia（巨人）"><a href="#42-Macrophilia（巨人）" class="headerlink" title="42. Macrophilia（巨人）"></a>42. Macrophilia（巨人）</h2><p>【只要不是我，可以是大沃姆】</p>
<p>Macrophilia—“sexual attraction to giants or giantesses,” according to Lehmiller—also represents a growing sector of the porn industry. Particularly arousing niches within this sexual interest include: being squished against a giant’s breasts, being crushed by a giant, being dominated by a giant, or being physically harmed by a giant. All of which seem pretty plausible in a giant-on-regular-sized-human sex scenario.</p>
<p>Though some macrophiles may be attracted to people that are just a few feet taller than them, macrophila is really about imagination. “It’s more based in fantasy and the use of animation, virtual reality, CGI porn, etc. to imagine and fantasize about being vulnerable, small, and powerless against a giant,” says McDevitt. Macrophiles tend to find pleasure from consuming this kind of content.</p>
<h2 id="43-Zoophilia（人兽）"><a href="#43-Zoophilia（人兽）" class="headerlink" title="43. Zoophilia（人兽）"></a>43. Zoophilia（人兽）</h2><p>【虽然我喜欢动物，但真的过了】</p>
<p>Consider Malcolm Brenner, a man whose name you may know thanks to the <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9qZXplYmVsLmNvbS9hLWNoYXQtd2l0aC1tYWxjb2xtLWJyZW5uZXItbWFuLWZhbW91cy1mb3ItaGF2aW5nLXNleC0xNjg1MDU5NDM2">intimately chronicled<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> romantic relationship he says he sustained with a dolphin, back in the 1970s. Their courtship (which also was briefly sexual) all took place at a theme park in Florida, and was allegedly “dolphin-initiated.” This man would be classified as a zoophile or someone who derives sexual arousal from animals.</p>
<p>Isn’t this just bestiality? Not quite. Zoophilia relies on emotional investment and, often, the idea that a human-animal relationship is mutually loving. Zoophilia is “more common among people who grow up on farms, and it’s also more common among people who have social interaction difficulties,” Lehmiller explains.”They might gravitate toward an animal partner rather than a human partner.”</p>

<p>Considered by some to be a subset of zoophilia, according to Lehmiller, formicophilia involves arousal “dependent upon small insects or creatures crawling on the body, especially the genital area, sometimes biting or stinging in the process.”</p>
<p>Lehmiller says he hasn’t se，en too much research into formicohpilia, but what’s available has mentioned ants, cockroaches, snails, and bees as possible sources of erotic pleasure.</p>

You may know these particular kinks under a different name: fetishes. Sexual fetishism is arousal caused by nonliving objects.</p>
<p>Fetishes can include just about anything, from garters, leather jackets, vibrators, a cherry on the pie, sex toys, cakes, sand and water, to the taste and smell of different items. Fetishes and object kinks are one and the same.</p>
<p>Want to better understand object kinks? Check out the stories below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: stockings with garters.</strong> “My boyfriend has a fetish—he wants me when I wear elegant stockings with garters. I already have a good deal of these garters, a perfect collection. There’s so much piquancy in this.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: glasses.</strong> “I think I love having sex with intelligent girls. I believe a girl to be intelligent when she wears glasses. That’s why I always choose poses that let me see her face and glasses.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: chef’s whites.</strong> “I’ve been recently dreaming about a chef in a five-star hotel. I fancy seeing him in his uniform with this funny hat on his head—I don’t think I’d manage to control myself! I would take him to the back room and… It is this toque</em> blanche <em>that makes me horny; dunno why, but this thing is my surefire desire exciter.”</em></p>
<h2 id="BODY-KINKS"><a href="#BODY-KINKS" class="headerlink" title="BODY KINKS"></a><strong>BODY</strong> <strong>KINKS</strong></h2><p>These are also objects, except these are “living” — body kinks refer to body parts or specific body types that light your sexual fire. For instance, some people might enjoy men and women with long, well-groomed hair. Others may get aroused by a slight figure, a curvaceous body, the absence of hair or even a specific presence, body odor and taste…</p>
<p>Are you in the mood for some kinky tales of body kinks?</p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: big booties.</strong> “Girls with big and plummy asses make me horny, and I don’t care whether they’re natural or it took a surgeon to make them look like this: it’s just mind-blowing when I see a girl and imagine bending her down, and then there’s the way her booty starts shaking…”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: white skin.</strong> “Someone may be enraptured by legs, arms and boobs, but as for me—I adore white skin. When I happen to see a girl like this, I cannot take my eyes off her, and when it is a man I get aroused at once.”</em></p>

This can be a threesome, group sex or public sex. Those watching are also participants in the process: they are the audience witnessing the selfless performance of the actors. If this interests you, consider it a marker of the group kink.</p>
<p>Let’s see what others have to say.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: public sex.</strong> “My husband and I have been together for a long time. Having visited a club for a kinky-party, we were surprised to find out that we enjoy having sex in public. Even when the desire was not that strong, the glances and gazes of other people ignited our sexual drive and made us dissolve into each other.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: group sex.</strong> “Whenever I happen to feel another body touch me at the disco, I become horny even without seeing the gender or the face of the person next to me; I understand that what makes me aroused is the idea that everyone present has come for pleasure, and if I imagine them all without clothes, I shall desire every man and woman on the dancefloor.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: threesome.</strong> “Our friends have always considered us to be an exemplary couple who love and respect each other. But very few of them know that we like threesomes and very often look for a third partner by using sex apps and searching clubs. When we add a third person, sex becomes even more vibrant, and we adore this joint seduction.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: corruption and training.</strong> “Every day I recall meeting my girl. When I was introduced to her, she had such a shy and innocent look, sitting there in her blue dress. And now we are in a serious relationship and she is second to none in sex—an embarrassed girl has turned into a daring and passionate woman. I had no idea she could be like this. When we go out together and she behaves in her sweet and tender way, I remember what she is in bed—and this is exciting as hell.”</em></p>
<h2 id="DOMINATION-AND-SUBMISSION-KINKS-–-THE-SWEET-COUPLE"><a href="#DOMINATION-AND-SUBMISSION-KINKS-–-THE-SWEET-COUPLE" class="headerlink" title="DOMINATION AND SUBMISSION KINKS – THE SWEET COUPLE"></a><strong>DOMINATION AND SUBMISSION</strong> <strong>KINKS – THE SWEET COUPLE</strong></h2><p>Someone plays the gray wolf while their partner is Little Red Riding Hood; someone acts as a servant while another becomes a master; someone plays a teacher while others prefer to be naughty female students. Some people always choose the leading role, give orders, manage the situation and take without asking.</p>
<p>Along these lines, there is always someone on top and someone on the bottom, one who dominates and a submissive who obeys without question, one who loves to cause pain and another ready to bear it for the benefit of the master. But never forget that the basic principles of <em>BDSM</em> lie in safety, voluntariness and right reason. It is not for nothing that the top is trusted—they hold the bottom’s wellbeing in their hands.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: domination over a Cinderella-man.</strong> “When my man helps his folks around the house, he always writes me an SMS saying: “Busy at the moment. Playing a Cinderella part.” After these words, I fancy him naked and wearing nothing but a housemaid’s apron, and I’m aching to fuck him… I can’t bear suppressing this desire. ;)”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: restricted mobility.</strong> “I love handcuffs so much… When I was having sex with my new partner for the first time, he chained me; in the heat of passion, I failed to notice this, yet when I heard the snap I almost climaxed that very second. And the fact that I did not know this man well enough even spiced things up. That was a hell of an orgasm!”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: submission to someone who is much stronger.</strong> “I get very horny—I can cum at once—the very second I touch my lover’s biceps or his brawny shoulders. With the whole of my</em> body <em>I feel his strength and power over me, and the idea of my helplessness simply drives me crazy; this is a kind of incredible emotional experience.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: partner’s roughness.</strong> “I had a good deal of partners who loved gentle sex. I met a girl recently. I started by being mild and gentle, as I’d learned from previous relationships. I petted and caressed her, but then I saw she was becoming even more aroused when I proceed to do things in a rough and forceful manner.”</em></p>
<h2 id="ROLEPLAYING-SCENE-ACTING-KINKS"><a href="#ROLEPLAYING-SCENE-ACTING-KINKS" class="headerlink" title="ROLEPLAYING / SCENE ACTING KINKS"></a><strong>ROLEPLAYING / SCENE ACTING</strong> <strong>KINKS</strong></h2><p>A no-nonsense boss by day—and an obedient secretary by night. A caring mother when visiting friends—and a slut in the bedroom. A run-of-the-mill manager in the real world—and a strict doctor in the realm of his fantasies. Trying someone else’s role on, stepping into their shoes for half an hour or half a day, becoming the opposite of yourself, playing pretend until you roll with ecstasy—this is a roleplaying kink.</p>
<p>Even if your partners stay the same, the situations that traditionally make you horny may change. If you view your partner as part of the setting or a piece of décor and you find more excitement in acting out a scene, roleplaying might be your kink.</p>
<p>You can draw inspiration for these kinks from movie storylines or even snapshots from everyday life, like talking to a railway guard, buying a car, asking for a dance, changing clothes, training an inexperienced student or managing a company.</p>

<p><em><strong>Kink: seduction by a lecturer.</strong> “I’m crazy about a lecturer. I cannot stop fancying him taking me right during the lecture, on the table, so that all of the students see it.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: extended seduction.</strong> “I adore the state of sexual arousal; I want to continue playing and flirting with my partner, getting more and more excited with every minute. To understand that I am almost dead excited and exhausted by desire, but to delay until the very last moment so that a single touch of his body against mine sends electricity running through my veins… As for him, I like him to empathize with all of my sensations and have fun, but during the whole</em> process <em>he feels exactly the same way that I do. It’s kind of sweet torturing each other.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: seducing a busy partner.</strong> “It turns me on to see my boyfriend concentrated on something. He looks so damn sexy when working or watching a film that I am ready to pounce on him right away.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: admiration.</strong> “I always want a man who admires me. Whenever I feel admiration, then his weight, age, sex and the size of his manhood (I mean both the body and financial standing) cease to matter to my body.”</em></p>

There are endless bans and prohibitions that people want to violate. This kink is a grim cocktail of shame, adrenaline, excitement and doubts: public places, social inequality, unplanned/spontaneous/inappropriate sex, sex with a stranger, sex with someone else’s partner… I’m sure you can add many entries to this list!</p>
<p>Let’s hear from some people who’ve already crossed the line.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: provocative clothing.</strong> “My colleague usually dresses in a rather straight-laced and feminine way that does not trigger any particular emotions. But sometimes she may put on something from a grunge style: ripped jeans, stretched T-shirts and no makeup. Somehow, it turns me on so much I want to grab her and press her against the wall and shag her somewhere in the WC. By the way, I’m a girl.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: ban violation.</strong> “I never allow my boyfriend to watch when I give him a blowjob. In fact, I put a sleep mask on him so that he can’t see. During the process, I notice him peeping and get a thrill out of it.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Kink: a man in women’s clothing.</strong> “I also have a very unusual fetish. I’m crazy about men wearing women’s clothes. I can’t help that I enjoy it.”</em></p>

The desire for seduction is mixed with both admiration and fear, the kind of fear that you have right before doing something new and terrifying. You might feel no fear when preparing to taste a new dish in a restaurant, yet when you throb with anxiety before your first visit to a swing-club, it means that you have an almost godlike reverence for whatever is about to happen next.</p>
<p>You may experience the same with people, so that every interaction with a certain person changes you. You understand that you will never be the same after having sex with him or her. If you have a kink like this, then this feeling will always stick with you, even as you proceed to seduce your partner with your actions, your body, your caressing. That person is always your god or goddess.</p>
<p>In essence, it’s like having the desire to find someone better than you: a “deity” you want to surrender yourself to, a man or a woman who could take you out of yourself. Someone who could make you <em>“believe that there was something more important on earth than myself…” (Henry Miller).</em></p>

You might want to write based on your sex life, but the fact of the matter is, sexual fantasy writing — just like sex — is all about give and take.</p>
<p>Find the balance between your sexual preferences and what people commonly like to great something that truly steams.</p>
<h3 id="SEX-WITH-SEVERAL-PEOPLE"><a href="#SEX-WITH-SEVERAL-PEOPLE" class="headerlink" title="SEX WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE"></a>SEX WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE</h3><p>While it’s much dirtier than most people would admit to, sex with several people is the <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc2V4dWFsLWZhbnRhc2llcw==">most common sexual fantasy<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> out there. This is wonderful news for a writer. Sex with several people means more characters, more creative situations, and more unique dynamics to explore.</p>
<p>There are many wonderful carnal moments that are achieved during sex with several people. However, the best sexual fantasy writing comes from exploring the psychology behind the fantasy.</p>
<p>Think about <em>why</em> the common person would want sex with many people.</p>
<p>A threesome is interesting, but it’s <em>more</em> interesting when a “girl-next-door” waitress who secretly harbors sexual fantasies begins to flirt with a couple at one of her tables. The flirting is innocent enough, but that night she masturbates because she can’t stop thinking about them. The next night, the couple comes back to the restaurant, and leaves their phone number on their bill next to their tip with a message that says “you’re cute, call us”.</p>
<p>From here, you can go anywhere you want with the actual details of the sex. The important part about writing a sexual fantasy is staging the scene so that it’s erotic <em>as well as</em> believable.</p>
<h3 id="EXHIBITIONISM"><a href="#EXHIBITIONISM" class="headerlink" title="EXHIBITIONISM"></a>EXHIBITIONISM</h3><p>Exhibitionism is a tough sexual fantasy to have since public sex can get you arrested. However, when you’re writing a sexual fantasy, you can liberate people’s sexual urges through the page. This is why writing about exhibitionism can be extremely fruitful for anyone creating a sexual fantasy.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look back at the exploits of our girl-next-door waitress.</p>
<p>Say that after she has a threesome with the couple, she finds herself working again next week, and sees the man from the couple at a table again. She flirts with the man while taking his order and asks where his girlfriend is. He explains that his girlfriend couldn’t make it and how much he missed her, all while fingering her under her skirt right at his table.</p>
<p>As you can see, the possibilities are endless when you set up unique situations.</p>
<h3 id="DOMINANCE-SUBMISSION"><a href="#DOMINANCE-SUBMISSION" class="headerlink" title="DOMINANCE/SUBMISSION"></a>DOMINANCE/SUBMISSION</h3><p>The BDSM community is no longer something strange you hear talked about in hushed whispers. The internet has made many <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdmaW5lYXJ0cy5jb20vZW1icmFjaW5nLXlvdXIta2luay1lc3NlbnRpYWwtYm9uZGFnZS10b3lzLWZvci1iZHNtLWxvdmVycy8=">wonderful BDSM sex toys<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> available to help anyone get into the wonderful world of dominance and submission.</p>
<p>While BDSM should <em>always</em> be practiced with safety and communication, the world of sexual fantasy writing is a safe place to explore the darker elements of people’s sexualities. Let’s check back in with our waitress, why don’t we?</p>
<p>Let’s say that after the encounter with the boyfriend, the waitress finishes up her shift and heads over to the couple’s house. There, she finds that the girlfriend is on the bed in lingerie, already masturbating. She explains that she’s been teasing herself all night and that her boyfriend (dom) told her not to orgasm until the waitress came over and ate her out.</p>
<p>Once you establish who your characters are, and how they find themselves in various kinky situations, writing the actual sex is a breeze. Creating a sexual fantasy is partially dependent on your sexuality, but it’s also largely based on pleasing your audience.</p>
<h2 id="STAY-CONCISE"><a href="#STAY-CONCISE" class="headerlink" title="STAY CONCISE"></a>STAY CONCISE</h2><p>Building up a great, sexy circumstance is over half of the battle when writing about sexuality. The rest of the battle comes down to the quality of your writing.</p>
<p>While you don’t need to be Shakespeare, bad writing will severely distract from your sexual fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>Leave conversations about characters’ emotions and internal monologue to a minimum. Focus on what characters say and do, rather than what they think and feel, so that your writing moves along smoothly. The audience can infer thoughts and emotions, which will enhance the reading experience.</strong></p>
<p>Your descriptions of places, people, and situations should be precise but brief. You don’t need to get into every last detail — make sure you keep the rhythm of the story moving. The <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9oZW1pbmd3YXlhcHAuY29tLw==">Hemingway app<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> is a wonderful tool to help you bring conciseness and precision into your writing.</p>
<h2 id="WRITING-A-FANTASY"><a href="#WRITING-A-FANTASY" class="headerlink" title="WRITING A FANTASY"></a>WRITING A FANTASY</h2><p>When it comes to sexuality, human beings are never short on imagination. Writing a fantasy is all about playing with the human imagination, and giving people a taste of what they don’t normally get in their everyday life.</p>
<p>Consider common fantasies, focus on the <em>situation</em> rather than the sexual details（虽然Se也很重要）, play with people’s imaginations, and keep your writing concise, and you’ll surely write a fantasy that will have people drooling for more.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Write-Realistic-Kink"><a href="#How-To-Write-Realistic-Kink" class="headerlink" title="How To Write Realistic Kink"></a>How To Write Realistic Kink</h1><p>We’re all looking for ways to improve our writing, or… at least I hope so. Why write if you’re not going to improve yourself?</p>
<h2 id="If-you’re-writing-erotica-containing-BDSM-and-kink-without-proper-research-it’ll-show"><a href="#If-you’re-writing-erotica-containing-BDSM-and-kink-without-proper-research-it’ll-show" class="headerlink" title="If you’re writing erotica containing BDSM and kink without proper research it’ll show."></a>If you’re writing erotica containing BDSM and kink without proper research it’ll show.</h2><p>Here are some basics to get you started.</p>
<p>\1. Your character(s) do not have to have a history of sexual abuse to be involved in a kinky lifestyle.</p>
<p>\2. Relying on porn or other erotic fiction for your research can lead you down a tunnel you meant to avoid.</p>
<p>\3. There are many websites, podcasts, TikToks, videos, and more where you can learn all the ins and outs of various kinks and fetishes.</p>
<p>Sure, sure… your story is fictional, but that does not mean people aren’t willing to try the things you write. And no, you’re not responsible for people who don’t research before trying out your acrobatic aerial scene. But do you really want someone to come back and review your story with “I tried xyz with my partner and we ended up in the ER!” No, no you do not.</p>
<p>Just because people should research kinky fuckery prior to enjoying it doesn’t mean that they will. You could always follow the ‘Don’t try this at home’ warning, but sometimes that makes people want to try it even more.</p>
<p>It’s best practice for people who do live kinky lifestyles is to test paddles and other pain-inducing toys on themselves before using them on their submissives. Why? Because they don’t want to end up in the emergency room.</p>
<h2 id="Things-to-think-about-when-you-write-fictional-kink"><a href="#Things-to-think-about-when-you-write-fictional-kink" class="headerlink" title="Things to think about when you write fictional kink:"></a>Things to think about when you write fictional kink:</h2><p>Why are your characters participating in this kind of kink? Yes, it should be more than ‘it gets them off.’ Many people in a kinky lifestyle enjoy it because they get something (not just orgasms) out of it. If you don’t understand what I’m talking about, check out the <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9sb3ZpbmdiZHNtLm5ldC8=">Loving BDSM<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> podcast by Kayla Lords and John Brownstone. They talk openly about their kinky life. Kayla explains how it makes her feel when JB spanks her and pulls her hair and that’s the sort of thing you want to think about to round out your kinky characters.</p>
<p>So, give some depth to your characters by adding layers of emotions, physical responses, and so forth to them when they experience their kink. And don’t forget — Dominants have feelings, too!</p>
<p><em>Pssst. Not all kink is about sex and orgasms. Sometimes, it’s just about the kink.</em></p>
<h2 id="Consent-Dubious-Consent-Consensual-Non-Consent"><a href="#Consent-Dubious-Consent-Consensual-Non-Consent" class="headerlink" title="Consent, Dubious Consent, Consensual Non-Consent"></a>Consent, Dubious Consent, Consensual Non-Consent</h2><p>I say ‘Consent in Everything’ because I mean it. Go to YouTube and search for videos on teaching consent. Go to TikTok and search videos about consent. You’ll learn a lot. Sure, we can joke and play and have fun, but once someone toes the line, you need a consent check.</p>
<p>Your characters have language and know how to communicate. Sure, it might be awkward — but that’s okay! We are awkward when we communicate. Not everyone can be a sassy, punny redhead. <em>flips hair</em> I’m lying. I’m the most awkward, but I also have a filter and it helps.</p>
<p>I may not ask the hard questions of people in real life, but I do when it comes to my characters. I need to know how much I can push, pull, bend, and poke at them. How long before they safe word? How long before they break, especially if I don’t want to break them).</p>
<h2 id="Dominants-Have-Feelings-Too"><a href="#Dominants-Have-Feelings-Too" class="headerlink" title="Dominants Have Feelings, Too"></a>Dominants Have Feelings, Too</h2><p>Which means they also have limits and boundaries just like submissives do. Dom/mes also need aftercare. They need to feel loved by their submissive. Show how your submissive takes care of their Dominant when things go sideways, or when they go totally right. Submissives aren’t mind readers any more than we are in real life, so this is also a learning experience. Everyone is bound to screw up, but that’s a great way to give your characters a way to grow by themselves and with each other.</p>
<h2 id="We-All-Need-Limits"><a href="#We-All-Need-Limits" class="headerlink" title="We All Need Limits"></a>We All Need Limits</h2><p>If you’re a submissive who says they have no limits, then I’m going to request your information and send it to my dear friend John Brownstone. He’ll teach you that limits and boundaries are a good thing to have. Probably in less than ten minutes. Okay, five minutes.</p>
<p>In fiction, what’s the point if your characters don’t have limits or boundaries? Anything at all can happen to them true, but why should we care? Give me a submissive who is unsure about being tied up but is willing to see if they like it. And if they don’t, or they get scared, which is a logical response, how they handle it.</p>
<p>Once they feel that fear they have a choice to make. Are they going to say their safe word? Are they going to say yellow which is a ‘wait, I need a moment, press pause’ signal?</p>
<p>Show me how they process the emotional and mental responses the physical sensations create.</p>
<h2 id="When-checking-your-kinky-fiction-ask-yourself"><a href="#When-checking-your-kinky-fiction-ask-yourself" class="headerlink" title="When checking your kinky fiction, ask yourself:"></a>When checking your kinky fiction, ask yourself:</h2><p>Are the people here for more than just an orgasm? If they’re not there for an orgasm, what are they getting out of the kinky play? How do they feel afterwards? Relaxed and sated or empowered and ready to take on the world? Or are they back to an even keel, able to handle the next day cool and calm?</p>
<p>Do your characters have a full set of senses? Touch, taste, hear, sight, smell — each one enhances a story if you have them or don’t have them.</p>
<p>Is consent shown? In real life it takes two moments, a few words, to garner enthusiastic consent. It should only take a couple of dialogue lines in your story, with a check here and there as well.</p>
<p>The more thought and time you put into writing your fiction, the more fun your readers will get out of it.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>t is hard to talk about sex and literature without making some sort of <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> reference. But where <em>Fifty Shades</em> shows a caricature of S&amp;M, the new anthology <em><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9ib29rc2hvcC5vcmcvYS8yNjkvOTc4MTk4MjExMDIxNQ==">Kink<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></em> is a celebration of the range of human desires. From the power of control and the titillation of voyeurism, this collection is a toe in the water that is sexuality. </p>
<p>With <em>Kink</em>, editors R.O. Kwon and Garth Greenwell sought to gather a diverse collection of stories which speak to the complexity of kink and human interactions. With stories from Brandon Taylor, Carmen Maria Machado, Alexander Chee, and more, this collection shines in its moments of small intimacy, especially in a time when touch and connection are so hard to find. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Parrish Turner: What does it mean to center kink when having conversations about sex, especially in literature?</strong></p>
<p><strong>R.O. Kwon:</strong> I have trouble answering that question in part because I have been just shying away from definitions of kink. I think especially with an anthology it does feel important for the definition to be as open as possible to however people want to define it. </p>
<p><strong>Garth Greenwell:</strong> It’s definitely true that from our first conversations, Reese and I were both really clear that the last thing we wanted to do was start drawing lines and saying “this is kinky and this isn’t.” We made it really clear that we were interested in work that writers felt was centered on kink, whatever that meant to them. </p>
<p>I too really shy away from trying to define what “kink” is. Whatever definitions I find myself reaching for are objectionable for different reasons. Like, if I say “non-normative sexual practices,” then that falls into the trap of a paradigm I don’t really believe in. I do think that something that is true about kinky practices is an understanding that sex is something that is staged and can be negotiated and potentially theatrical or have elements of ritual. Just that sex is something that doesn’t just happen. It is something that we are agents in staging and negotiating. </p>
<p><strong>ROK:</strong> One result of centering kink maybe can help demonstrate something that I very much believe, which is that there is no such thing as normative sex and that the norms are bogus and largely harmful. </p>
<p><strong>GG:</strong> And community that forms around certain sexual practices and that that was something that was interesting to us. Seeing those communities on the page was exciting to us. </p>
<p><strong>PT: Part of what interests me about centering kink in sex is that I see this as part of a shift in the way that we talk about sex in literature. What we define as pornography or erotica is kind of shifting. How did that impact how you approached an anthology of sex stories?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>ROK:</strong> I feel as though Garth will have a closer viewpoint on this. I do feel as though there has been and continues to be more pushing back against the idea that there are any genres at all and the idea that genres have to be separate. It feels as though Garth’s writing is very much a part of this as Garth has been such a stalwart and eloquent defender and champion of the place sex has in literature. And it’s wild that anyone thinks it doesn’t have a place. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>GG:</strong> One of the things I find myself pushing back a lot is against easy notions of pornographic as a term of derision. That supposed dichotomy. That there is something about serious literature that prevents putting sexual bodies graphically on the page is something that I think is dumb and I utterly reject. </p>
<p><strong>PT: Tied to that is the impact that having so many queer perspectives in the anthology. Part of what you are referencing is what is “okay” to portray and as a wider variety of queer lives are being portrayed in “mainstream” literature. I often felt as a teenager that anything I did was kinky just because I wasn’t straight.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>GG:</strong> We’ve been fielding a lot of questions about an overlap of kinkiness and queerness, which clearly there is no easy identity between the two, but I think it is true historically that queer communities have been amenable to kink practices and kink communities have been amenable to queer people. One thing I hope the anthology does is multiply our sense of what both of those terms mean. If someone has an easy idea of kink as just bringing whips or handcuffs into the bedroom, which is certainly part of kink, but the anthology makes clear that’s not the only way to think about what kink is. And I hope the anthology also makes clear that there is not just one paradigm for what queerness looks like either. </p>
<p><strong>ROK:</strong> The anthology is predominantly queer. Which I love. I think it’s so queer that at some point Garth and I were looking at our list like “Wait, do we even have a single straight person?” We ended up with one or two, but barely any. It was really important to us that the anthology be as inclusive as possible. It happened so organically too, it just happened.</p>
<p><strong>PT: That makes sense when trying to get a variety of perspectives on kink and sex, of course queer people are going to be involved with that. I am also curious about the range of ethnic identities represented in this collection. That diversity should be standard practice, but I am wondering the impact that had on the specific stories in the collection, especially given the intersection of race and sexuality. I am thinking along the lines of stereotypes about various groups and their sex lives.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>ROK:</strong> A general rule for myself is that, when I’m spearheading a project or event, I try to never have more white people than people of color involved in a project or event. </p>
<p>Instead of generalizing, I will speak for myself. I didn’t read any Korean writers until after college and I didn’t get serious about it until after graduate school. A large part of it was that I didn’t know there were any of us out there. And when I was getting out of college, there were far fewer of us than there are now. There is always that consciousness that, in putting out a story with S&amp;M with a Korean central character in it, I haven’t read much of that so there is always that doubled consciousness. That said, I know when I’m writing, I try to never think about stuff like that. I try to never wonder about the weight that that puts on the story that I’m trying to make. For me, I’m conscious of it, but I try to not let it bother me. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great writers of sex have always recognized that bodies are situated in history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GG:</strong> That’s so smart. Part of my proselytizing about what good sex can do in literature, I think it’s a really powerful way to talk about history and cultural situated-ness. Great writers of sex have always recognized that bodies are situated in history and much of the meaning of our bodies and therefore ourselves is not made by us but assigned to us. One of the things that kinky sexual practices can do, and several of the stories in the anthology show them doing, is try and take some of that assigned meaning, by making it theatrical, making it something that one has some control over. To sort of make that assigned meaning visible and therefore negotiable and a source of an assertion of agency. I also think that you see if you read Toni Morrison, who is a great writer of sex, James Baldwin, Raven Leilani… A characteristic of great writing about sex is an awareness of the fact that sex is historical and the meanings our bodies make is always historically and culturally situated. That is part of the pressure put on the scene just by the scene being fully written. </p>
<p><strong>PT: So your book is coming out during Covid. Have you see the way that Covid has changed the way that we talk about sex and how this book might be talked about differently when it comes out?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>ROK:</strong> Yes, the book comes out February 9, five days before the most wretched Valentine’s Day in the history of Valentine’s Days. I saw someone said on Twitter that the great thing about this book is that, because there are so many kinds of desire portrayed, a really fun thing to do is to underline passages with interests of your own and you could hand it off to somebody you might be getting involved with. This is glorious.</p>
<p><strong>GG:</strong> That is a great idea. I am really shocked at how much the affective emotional power of literature has shifted for me. I was on a book tour for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374718145"><em>Cleaness</em></a> when everything shut down. <em>Cleaness</em> became a radically different book after Covid for me. The idea of touch, the idea of intimacy. That is true of this anthology too. It is such a difficult time. This is true for a lot of queer people, [but] so much of my erotic life relied on the free circulation of bodies. That part of my erotic life has just shut down because it’s hugely unsafe. It’s not as though anything on the page changed, but the meaning of the book changed for me. </p>
<p><strong>PT: I listen to Dan Savage’s podcast and early in the pandemic, he talked about the rise of financial doms post the 2008 financial crisis. He speculated on how the pandemic would affect fetishes. Like how will our fetishes change to respond to our tramas?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GG:</strong> Will there be coughing fetishes? There probably already are. Anything you can imagine, someone is probably turned on by it. It both horrifies me and gives me hope about humanity. </p>
<p><strong>ROK:</strong> Years and years ago, I read this column by Dan Savage and someone wrote in to tell him about their specific scuba diving fetish and they just wanted to have sex in scuba diving gear. They were so ashamed and didn’t know how to bring this up. And there were so many lovely replies of people being like I would be so down, it sounds so nice and chill. </p>
<p><strong>GG:</strong> It sounds great. Nobody gets hurt! </p>
<p><strong>ROK:</strong> It warmed my heart; I almost cried. All these people saying “You’re fine.” I wish we lived in a world where people could experience more of that openness and far less of the shame and the punishment and sorrow and loneliness. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many things that people are ashamed of that do no harm. I love the idea of a world that is more accommodating to those things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GG:</strong> Queer writers have been aware of the ways promiscuity and kinky practices are a practice in humanness. T Fleischmann talks about this kind of promiscuity as a kind of practice of sociality. I feel very grateful for promiscuity for that. There have been so many tender moments. There have been so many moments where a stranger has said to me “I’m into this weird thing.” And there is this kind of vulnerability and fearfulness in that, but it calls such a tenderness from me. I feel very grateful for moments when it has been possible to say yes to these things. There are so many things that people are ashamed of that do no harm. I love the idea of a world that is more accommodating to those things. </p>
<p><strong>PT: Anthologies function as part of a conversation in and of themselves. What are your hopes for how this book fits into the narrative in ten years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ROK:</strong> I can speak to one of my hopes. I personally am exhausted beyond belief by the ways that kink and S&amp;M are portrayed in movies and TV shows. There are so many serial killers! The percentage of kinky people who are serial killers is just wild to me. There aren’t that many serial killers and there are so many kinky people. That kind of stereotype is incredibly harmful. I just think of the 11-year-old who thinks “the only thing I know about people that want the things my body seems to want is that they are serial killers.” I would love for that caricature to be gone. </p>
<p>This is only one book and we wanted the book to be as inclusive as possible, but there is so much that isn’t in here. I would love if in ten years there is nothing remarkable about this book being centered on kink. </p>
<p><strong>PT: I feel like if people were given spaces to be honest about what they want, they would be way less likely to be a serial killer. Tina Horne has a podcast and she talks about how you can work through your shit through kink in this safe environment and if you need it to stop it can stop. And you can push yourself and you are better prepared for the real world. The therapeutic nature of being on good terms with your desire.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>ROK:</strong> Oh, being on good terms with our desires. I wanna get there. </p>
